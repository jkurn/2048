decades tossing and turning throwing blankets off pulling the back onone putting one leg on top and repeating all of that ad nauseum but now I am falling asleep in record time why because I'm using a device was recommended to me by friends called the Pod cover by 8 sleep the Pod cover fits on any mattress and allows you to adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment providing the optimal temperature that gets you the best night's sleep with the Pod covers Dual Zone temperature control you and your partner can set your sides of the bed to as cool as 55¬∞ or as hot as 110¬∞ I think generally in my experience my partners prefer the high side and I like to sleep very very cool so stop fighting this helps based on your Biometrics environment and sleep stages the Pod cover makes temperature adjustments throughout the night that limit wakeups and increase your percentage of deep sleep in addition to its best-in-class temperature regulation the Pod cover sensors also track your health and sleep metrics without the need to use a wearable conquer this winter season with the best in sleep Tech and sleep at your perfect temperature many of my listeners in colder areas sometimes

this altitude I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking can I ask you a personal question now we a see the broken time what if I did the opposite I'm a cybernetic organism living dissue over metal [Music] endoskeleton hello boys and girls ladies and germs this is Tim Ferris welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferris show and this is one of my favorite types of episodes of course I'm speaking to world class performers of all different disciplines all the time but one of my favorite people to ask for advice is Seth Goden and this is a Walkin talk which means Seth and I were walking and talking while we recorded this and I had many burning questions I wanted to ask he did not fail to deliver a lot of sage advice tactical practical wisdom and what more can I say the guy's a gem he delivers every time who is Seth Goden you might ask Seth Goden is the author of 21 International bestsellers that have changed the way people think about work his books have been translated into 38 languages and Seth's books include tribes Purple Cow lynchpin the dip and this is marketing Seth writes one of the most popular marketing blogs in the world 8500 8,500 plus daily blog posts just to put that into perspective and two of his TED Talks are among the most popular of all time he is the founder of the alt MBA the social media Pioneer squid do and yo-yo dine one of the first internet companies his latest book is the song of significance a new Manifesto for teams you can find him at Seth golden.com and you can find Seth's blog at seth. blog so you can go to both of those for a lot of resources and I'm going to just reiterate why we did this format the way we did it because there's too much sitting in the world it's not good for you we weren't evolved to do it and I am trying to counteract the trend the impulse all the incentives to do podcasts in a fixed location this isn't good for my health and it's certainly not good for your health to force you to consume it that way so I'm at least experimenting with being out and about doing something that we are designed to do and that is walk so without further Ado please enjoy my wide ranging conversation where I ask for a lot of help from Seth Goen all right here we are so thank you again for taking the time and the subject I suppose relates to time attention all these good things which is how to make Tim Ferris is incredibly long form writing shorter or how those two things fundamentally are different in terms of long and short I texted you asking if there's any Secret Sauce any tips or tricks for writing short blog posts because I consider you the Undisputed King of consistently good short blog posts and that kind of Uncorked all of this so here we are and uh I suppose where I might want to start is with our initial text thread and one of the points that at least as I read it seemed to resonate was treating blog posts more as a question than an answer or a provocation rather than a prescription could you expand on that a little bit because I think it relates also to the post that you so kindly proof read where I may have misinterpreted how best to think about that I would be delighted to dive in there are so many places to start I'm going to start with this you are a gifted and generous writer and you have been since I began tracking what you do and blogging is inherently a generous act because it's hard in 2024 to justify it as a financial Endeavor you're doing it to illuminate and what does it mean to write in this form a short story attributed to Ernie Hemingway probably not for sale baby shoes never worn six words it's perfect in six words your heart breaks that's not scalable practical repeatable you can't sign up to write six word short stories that break people's hearts every day because that level of condensing that level of being able to get at the heart none of the words had more than seven letters none of the words have more than two syllables that's magic right we can't repeatedly do that so when we look at the form of a Blog we say well you know Seth's blog posts have 100 to a thousand words in them all I have to do is take my idea and make it shorter and when we try to do that resistance kicks in pressfield's resistance and we say but I need to clarify this sentence and add a parenthetical to that sentence or else I will be misunderstood so this first sentence in this paragraph which is Rich and detailed and recursive and layered goes like this growth agents have a place in medicine parentheses some types of hypop poopari inis wasting syndromes diseases surgical care Etc and some sports effectively require them at higher levels but there are always trade-offs when you turn on the dials on complex hormonal Cascades and feedback loops y everything in that is true and someone could study that sentence in college for a month because there's layers below layers below layers and unfortunately the blog reader in general is not ready to consume that level of condensation mhm and so we shouldn't even try because that's not what a Blog is good at mhm what a Blog is good at is what Scott McLoud taught us about Comics Scott mccloud's book about Comics which is a must read I have read it or understanding Comics is the one that I read understanding Comics thank you yes the key lesson is this Comics work because something happens between the panels uh right and panel one Superman sees a problem in panel two Superman is with the villain we don't see how Superman got from panel one to panel two that happened in our brain so the reason Bad Comics and bad graphic novels are bad is because the Creator didn't understand that they didn't let our brain do the leaping they just decided to add a lot of pictures to a story that would be better in words so what a blog post does is it says here's a sketch over here and now I'm over there you figure out how I got from here to there and by you figuring it out the reader you will grow you will explore you will be a voice in this dialogue it is not just me talking MH so when you ask me to review your writing some people are tempted to proofread and they don't really mean proofread they mean copy edit and copy editing means fix the errors and what I'm trying to do when I'm editing a friend work is say are they even asking the right question cuz they can fix their own errors they don't need my help to do that and so here what I'm trying to say is what is this post for and what it's for I think is to help someone who's not paying attention to realize that there are seven things they might want to think about and seven is a lot so what I pitched back to is this is actually seven blog posts in a series and what the first one says is you know there's some things you're not thinking about that you might want to think about here's one of them and the idea if I just say to somebody biceps are temporary baseball helmet sizes are forever they visualize that immediately MH and then they're like H what and then they want to think about what you meant by that it's a ha cou it's a puzzle it's a shadow where is the light and what is being reflected so now you gotten permission to tell me in a paragraph or two what you meant and then I can you get to say and I say and that is the form that is what blogs are good at but and I'm going to end my rant now the downside is you will be misunderstood and that is why there are no comments on my blog because people who misunderstood a post would then respond by making me feel bad so I would over right and overwrite so they wouldn't do that anymore and then it wasn't a Blog anymore so I had to stop and basically what I'm saying is if you don't get it ask a friend and if they don't get it either come back tomorrow and we can discuss a new thing and I think the king of this is actually the magic of XKCD which is a Blog in graphic form yeah it's outstanding I agree on that and as you're talking a few things come to mind for me and maybe as a backdrop the for a lot of this for me at least is number one to get back into writing and to experiment with a new form a new style a new approach to writing and number two is to explore ideas to explore ideas in various ways to clarify my own thinking Y which ended up happening in this short piece the no biological free lunch piece that you proof read I suppose my question not copyedited which is certainly a very different thing in this particular case if you were writing this would you be inclined to make it a series or would you make each of these a standalone piece in other words of those seven bullets as you're thinking through not just the word count right this is my mistake where I basically said okay instead of writing a 5,000 word blog post I'm gonna make it less than a thousand but I'm G to try to still somehow get all of the concepts into this shorter form seems like there's a conceptual con straint that makes things powerful but would you take those seven make them into an interrelated series would you make them all kind of independent after you introduce them in this one piece how would you think about divvying this up conceptually for yourself and I should also just add one more thing which is yeah fundamental to all of these observations and questions and goals and dreams of mine is how do I make this sustainable for me right which is part of the feedback you gave in the comments on on the draft of this blog post was I'm paraphrasing but if you try to just make the 5,000 words thing a th000 words it's going to be exhausting for you and most likely also exhausting for your readers which I agree with this about genre so my blog is a long running series it has been a series of 8,500 Daily Posts so if I was starting today I have to figure out what is the genre of my work if you think about David Letterman TV show mhm he needed to have a series called stupid pet tricks cuz the show wasn't stupid pet tricks but there was a regular recurring stupid petrick right the show was a series of David Letterman shows so if your genre as you reenter blogging is uh there is a post from Tim on a regular basis and all of them are about the things we put into our body and performance that you're fine if that's not the case then the question is when the reader shows up do you need to do a lot of throat clearing to get them back on track for what you are writing about today and so since you're starting with largely a blank slate I said well if the first seven of these are in this series then you only have to clear your throat once on the 8th day and say okay now we're talking about this and you could do one of those or six of those or 12 of those mhm but people do better if they understand that they're going to see Dune not read the power broker those are different genres and you need to give them a hint as to what they're going to get I like the idea of recognizing that my tendency is to how should I be generous with myself be comprehensive was gonna say over complicate but let's be nice try to be comprehensive I would rather as we talked about earlier I'm walking by tennis court right now and I remember taking a tennis lesson and I kept hitting the ball into the net and the coach said to me he's like you can do anything now next step you can hit the ball straight up in the air you can hit a home run the one thing you cannot do is hit it into the net and I was like okay I got it and I kind of feel like I need to give myself some marching orders like that for writing to counterbalance some of my Tendencies so I like the idea of writing self sustaining independent pieces to restrict myself from the desire to say you know what I'm not going to overwrite this but it's going to be part one in a 12p part series which is uh maybe a workaround uh for tricking myself I'm gonna interrupt you for a little bit the please do you are extraordinarily skilled at not over complicating your writing or your narratives that's how you got this far that there's very little that you have published where you were the primary researcher and the Breakthrough creator of the original science what you've done is helped people simplify understand what's Happening Here is resistance you are adding parentheticals to protect yourself 100% MH so what I'm pushing you to do is to come up with boundaries so that you can say I did a good job and ship the work now that could involve having very like the rules of ha cou very significant rules where you must have a tagline to come online that's less than 18 wordss and you are allowed to have two footnote links but the rest of it has to be a narrative that you would say to somebody on the telephone and instead of typing them you are just recording each one and letting someone on your team type them if that would be the model you would have to let go of it because you only have a 5-minute phone call you're going to say it as clearly as you can you can add two links when you're done and it's done you got to ship it right but that's not letting the reader down because you've announced to them that that's what this is the genre matters I asked you one question related to how you know when you're done and I'd love for you to answer that again because I suspect I'll have some follow-up questions and either before or after that I would love to know for yourself what typee of rules you have imposed or constraints SL boundaries when you have had your better streaks of writing let's just say all right well we I'll do the first part first because it's easier you asked how do you decide or no when a post is done and I texted back I don't that's the point and then I wrote imagine how hard it would be to have a conversation or even a text thread if we had to Think Through whether our turn to talk was over before we stopped talking right so my model my ritual is I write blog posts in advance and then the night before I review them I rewrite them I delete them so if I get the stomach flu there's still going to be a blog post tomorrow and when I rewrite a blog post the rule is you wa get points if you make it shorter you don't get points if you make it longer and if I can't boil it down more than it already is and it's not deliberately deceptive it's done because the purpose is tell people something they already sort of know in a way that they would be grateful for the chance to forward to other people can you say that one more time Seth that seems important if I can show up with something in your bones you know to be true or interesting or worth thinking about but I can say it in a way that would benefit you if you could share it with your friends and colleagues that's a great blog post benefit you in what possible senses I will give you a trivial one first which is more than once I have blogged about how stupid it is that there's a pull down menu when you're checking out of a shop and there's all 50 states listed that isn't helping anybody we have have ai that can speak English it knows how to turn NY into New York and we do this because 40 years ago or whenever the web was young 25 years ago it was a hack that made life slightly easier for certain programmers and it's just been sticking around ever since there are people like me it really vexes and if I say this and you are one of those vexing people now you can forward it to your Web Master and say see see I said we shouldn't this and so I just gave you a useful thing to share that's trivial but that's sort of the idea is that if you have a brother or a son or a colleague or daughter or a sister who would benefit from the Insight that you think I'm on to you're going to forward it to them and you're going to have a connection with them CU I opened the door and made it possible for you to do that every once in a while I do post something about Claude AI that you didn't know know about and know you go oh great I use Claud thank you very much but that's not really the service my blog offers the service my blog offers is not I'm breaking news it's I am trying to illuminate things that already resonate with people not to add too many parentheticals to this conversation but what is CLA but what is Claude AI Claude AI I can't believe I know something you don't know claw. a is significantly better then chat GPT at certain functions and I think part of it is cuz it doesn't read the web or it says it doesn't read the web so it's not easily distracted but I'm launching a software project in six weeks and the business plan took more than a year and a whole bunch of contributors it's 40 pages long and I uploaded the business plan to Claude And I said please review this highlight contradictions paradoxes and obvious errors and in less than 10 seconds it me a page and a half MBA quality memo that nailed it it just nailed it nailed it nailed it and I was like okay you got me that's great that's great so I use Claude AI every day to read other people's writing my writing critique it give me Insight you could send your post to Claude and it might not have the Insight I had but it would definitely have something to say incredible all right well end parenthesis what are some other elements or practices or constraints or fill-in the blank that have helped you with consistency in terms of blog writing because I have attempted and failed a number of times to build up momentum writing shorter posts and I think a lot of what we've already discussed will help is there anything else that you would add to the it helped my consistency streak category well I would say two things first I think you're talking about consistency in terms of showing up at the Ballpark every day Cadence yeah exactly yeah so I'll do that one second the first one I have never met Larry David but I am guessing that there are some days that Larry David is actually a nice thoughtful person and there is a character named Larry David as well so the person who writes my blog is a character named Seth Goden and I am the only person who has ever written my blog I the only person who ever will write my blog but when I am doing it I am playing the character named Seth goed so if it doesn't sound like me if it's just me authentically being tired or annoyed I don't publish those because that's not what my character would do it's this is not me exposing some mystical mythical Seth Goden to the world it's me portraying the character Seth Goden CU it's a service and then the second thing is streaks are usually used against us by software and if they make you feel bad it's not a helpful thing but I write blog posts every single day whether I use them or not and I learned that from Isaac azimov when I worked with him all those years ago if you know that tomorrow morning you have to start typing tonight when you go to sleep or today when you're walking around you will be noticing things so that you have something to type and you know I've have enough in reserve that I don't have to do it every day but I do it every day because I eat lunch every day and because I take a shower every day two follow-ups so the first is related to the playing the character of Seth Goden it sounds like if I heard you correctly you're saying your writing should reflect how you feel in the world at the time that you're writing am I hearing that correctly no it's it's the opposite of that it's the opposite there's no should here first of all if someone wants to write a blog that's just the unvarnished version of them in the moment go for it I don't care I'm not the blog police what I'm saying is I can read a blog post I wrote 14 years ago and I might not write the same one today but it rhymes with the one I would write today because there's a voice that this character has that I am very comfortable with I did the first thing that all writers do when I got chat GPT which is I asked it to write like me and I was pleased to discover it was a parody of me and being able to be parodied is a really good sign and that's what it is to have this voice is to say I could exaggerate it in six different directions and people could tell I would be parodying it but like you know the Peanuts comic strip Charles Schultz did it every single day and it's very hard to tell which decade a peanut strip is from totally and that's that's what I'm after so just to unpack that a little bit more I know we've talked before or I should say I've asked and listen to you discuss how the authenticity fetishizing that goes on is often not always but often very misplaced and just kind of overvalues this oversharing what are the things that make Seth the character Seth the character is it 80% voice that you've developed such that chat GPT can imitate you and Par to you what are the other ingredients that make Seth the character who writes on Seth's blog you know I've not ever pushed myself to name them because seeing is forgetting the name of what one sees but yeah I guess I'd highlight a couple things the first one is I try to begin from a place of the benefit benefit of the doubt of there probably aren't bad people there's just situations that cause people to do things that are troubling and a level of optimism to go with it I try to reduce ideas to their Essence without becoming hyperbolic because the voices of social media amped up the hyperbolic part that's not a simplification that's an exaggeration right I try to eliminate parentheticals unless I really have no choice so I will avoid saying something like all tall people are very brave because that's ridiculous but I will not write tall people or Brave parentheses except for this person this person this person and this person because now it's not worth reading right so there's an assertion at the beginning that creates a t and then a release of that tension that lands an idea so the shortest blog post I ever wrote which I'm really proud of is first line is you don't need more time so that's an assertion it's controversial people who feel overwhelmed want to challenge it and then the delivery is you just need to decide so that flips it upside down takes the blame off off the system and the people who are making you busy and puts it right back on you giving you agency and authority and responsibility to Simply decide and then get back to what needs to get done and so in just a few words that's an example of a short Seth Goen blog post and a longer one is one where I will try to teach somebody details about something they didn't know but frame it in a way that they're comfortable with because that's how they might have framed it as well let me ask a quick question and maybe that I've cut back on my caffeine too significantly but you don't need more time you just need to decide what are people deciding well folks who say I'm going to figure out which college I want to apply to soon I just need to do more research I just need to think about it I got it right close the open Loops get it done make a decision exactly mhm that makes a lot of sense just a quick

have discussed it what are some other things you picked up from Isaac azimov I mean this guy's a demigod at least a lot of people would consider him one what are things you absorbed or observed with Isaac Isaac was in his 70s I was 24 and a half maybe 25 it was one of my first projects it was one of his last ones and we would hang out in his apartment near Lincoln Center and I got to spend time with his wife the thing about Isaac azimov is the character of Isaac azimov was a know-it-all egomaniac for the time today he would be seen as humble but he he published 400 books he invented the modern conception of a robot he wrote seminal work on an enormous number of topics a definitive book about the Bible I mean all over the place but in person he was humble and funny and as a project partner he was completely hands off he spent time with me to make sure I understood the bound Ines of what an Isaac aam project was and then he said go for it and he didn't micromanage a thing because he trusted me and my understanding of where the robots Universe could go and it spoiled me because I thought that was going to happen again and again and again and you know I got Stanley Kaplan into the test prep book business and it took seven years and by the time we the book Stanley was long gone from the project CU he had sold the company but talk about micromanaging with a well-known name so I'm one end of the spectrum was Isaac azimov and on the other end was Stanley Kaplan go figure you know your story about azimov makes me think a little bit of Rick rubben where right out of the gate LL Cool J BC boys he's like oh this is easy this is how it works fantastic what was the project that you're were working with isacon okay so before DVDs lots of people had VCRs and yes I remember a company called Parker Brothers took their board game Clue and they made it into a VCR game and it was Dumb and it sold more than a million copies at $40 wow good for them and so Peter alatka the greatest game designer of his generation and I invented a murder mystery game you could play on your VCR so there was a movie shot with real Union actors in a set in New York City it lasted 38 minutes and took place on another planet about robots and murder and detectives and six times during the short film a screen came up and said hit the pause button and play a card so you would hit pause and you had a stack of six cards and each card had two sides and you would throw a card down and it would be a clue like there are no fingerprints on the gun which might mean it was a robot cuz robots don't have fingerprints right and on the other side of the card it said there were fingerprints on the gun so now you know it's not a robot so it turned out that 2 to the^ of 6 is 150 six or whatever and if you added up the code numbers on the top of each card you played it told you which page in the answer booklet had the answer to that thread through the game so you could play the game hundreds of times and it would be a different outcome each time and we sold the rights to Kodak and cisc and Ebert gave it two thumbs up and advertised it on the Olympics like the full thing it was fascinating wow where were you in your career that that opportunity presented itself or you found that opportunity what had led up to that outside of what you just described so before I did that I had only one real job and my job was at Spiner software we invented educational computer games and I built the first brand of Illustrated computer adventure games I worked with Arthur C Clark and Ray Bradbery and Michael Brighton I got rights to games I worked with Byron price he had a team of programmers and I had a team of programmers we did The Wizard of Oz and I loved it I could still be doing it to this day but the world changed and I was out on my own after a couple years as a book packager but Peter and I knew each other and the momentum from the interactive game thing led me to Isaac's editor and no one had ever asked for the rights the rights weren't expensive and then once I had the rights I found Kodak and Kodak was able to put up the money so we could build this thing and own part of the back end so if I zoom out I have a macro level question for you which has been on my mind a lot if you don't mind which is a question of how you choose next chapters or projects because I'm coming up on the 10th anniversary of the podcast next April so in a few months and figured that would be a good a time as any to pause and reflect on things and think about where I want to go love doing the podcast don't plan on stopping it but there are a lot of Trends driving it towards effectively turning podcasts into fixed location television shows and I don't have much desire to do that y I don't want to be contrarian just for the sake of being contrarian that's its own trap or set of traps but I know you've been very deliberate for instance in choosing not to start a dozen startups and and in favor of choosing to spend your time on other things how do you choose or think about kind of next chapters or how what advice might you give me as I contemplate for what's next type of question you know I think it's very kind of you to say I'm very good at it I don't think I'm good at it but because I'm sort of in public and I do it in a certain way it's noted you know I did five years of a Kimbo it was in the top 1% of all podcasts and then I just stopped and I stopped not because I didn't love it I did love it I stopped because if I kept doing it there's something else I wouldn't do instead and creating a vacuum is required so that I will do the hard work of filling the vacuum but if I just keep doing the thing then there is no vacuum and sometimes the technology changes that's why Spiner went away that's why you couldn't keep making VCR games it's why my Head Start in the cdrom business was worthless cuz CD ROMs went away i' liked in every time I did this being a Pioneer in a New Media space because that's for me the funnest spot and then when the technology changes I got to move on but podcast technology is never going to change I mean you're noting there's a change in the production format and that is a change so in my case what I'm trying to do is not maximize my my income per hour spent nor am I trying to maximize the size of my audience what I'm trying to maximize is are the people I'm serving glad that I did that I showed up to solve an interesting problem and two as I build the stack of things on the bookshelf behind me can I point to them and say that was interesting and generous and I'm glad I did it and you know that's part of a limited attention span theater so it's not for everybody but my whole point of view is that life is projects it is not a job and when you stopped the podcast and created that vacuum did you already have something kind of warming up in the batting cage that was pending that you need to create that vacuum for or did you create the vacuum and then wait for something to get pulled into it not to strain the metaphor but you get the idea no you're not straining it if there's something pending it's not a vacuum there have been times when something so good came along I did it and then how to remove things so I could do it you know when a few of us started squido which was one of the first social networks I had a completely or reorganized my life because we built the 40th biggest website in the US with only eight employees so we were busy this is not what I'm talking about I am talking about an actual uncomfortable vacuum where you feel like you're never going to work again where nothing can possibly be worth what you gave up and that's hard to do yeah it is to do so just to put a put a microscope on that I have as means of backstory done this for periods of time and have found it deeply deeply uncomfortable sometimes fruitful often times not terribly fruitful in part I think because when I create that vacuum I don't know if the best way to embrace the vacuum is to basically just stare at the wall and watch paint dry or to do something else and my mind just kind of folds in on itself you create the VAC and then what do the next few weeks look like in terms of how you spend your time dayto day or week to week I think a fundamental difference between you and me there are so many of them but one of them as I am here talking to what the world Tango Champion former world record holder a long time ago yes is the only thing I have a world record in is being part of the largest co-author book signing in history in which me and 400 other people all signed our book at the same time because I am not a high performer I am interesting and being interesting is really important to me but I am not holding myself to the standard you hold yourself in so many ways and so I could imagine that the thing that gives me Comfort might not make you happy right for sure I agree with all of that and how does that difference translate to what you would do in the weeks following creating the vacuum after say stopping the podcast because I guess you have activities that you're still carrying forward it's not like you're completely idle you're writing still presumably if someone looked at me from the outside I think that they would see that my days aren't that different I am not shipping public work because I don't ship junk but I am internally creating lots of mediocre work and basically creating straw people and saying what would this be like and then what would that be like and here's this thing and I sat with my 60 or 80 watt laser cutter and I cut this thing out what do I think of that and um that invention cycle is joyful but I can't do it forever because I also need the satisfaction of shipping the work and not giving into resistance so what I'm doing when I was a book packager we sold 120 books in 10 years a book a month but I had more than 800 books on my hard drive ready to go not finished but two page five page proposals because the only way to have a finished proposal for me is to have an unfinished one that you didn't ship what is it and this is probably a fundamental question I should have asked earlier but what did you get from writing and having written as consistently as you have and do what is the payoff like why do that okay so the biggest payoff is simple not in terms of equity stock value but in terms of the noise in my head the biggest benefit is I will be writing tomorrow because it's Friday not because I've written the perfect blog post that every single day something gets published by me because I decided that 24 years ago not because I have reconsidered each day whether this one is good enough mhm and even if no one read my blog I would still do it and I'm very fortunate that people give me the benefit of the doubt knowing that I am not guaranteeing this is the best thing I ever wrote and they're still willing to look at it so that's lovely in terms of my professional practice again back to genre having a cure a platform where for a long time if you type blog into Google I was the first match because I just showed up more than just about anybody there's a lot of value to saying this is my lane and you can count on me in this Lane and for someone who is as paretic as I in their creative Pursuits having one of those turned out to be a really useful thing you mentioned a word that I don't recognize but I love the sound of ccure what is that yeah it's a safe haven a niche a place to hide a fortress what a great word yeah all right mental note to use cure well I don't want to take up a ton of time here south this is all incredible incredibly helpful the best part of my day and I know that you're not publishing this as written but I just want to say as for the people who were wondering what's in this magical thing you wrote it includes the line like Patagonian toothfish has become Chilean seab Baths on fashionable menus worldwide right there that's gold Jerry that's just gold and so you need to liberate these things and explain to people what the I know what you're talking about but the fact is that entire species are becoming extinct because somebody figured out a clever way to Market an animal that we eat there's a lot to be said about that one little riff and you have 20 of them in one post thanks man yeah the the no biological freelan it's one of those things things that I've said so many times to friends in conversation and I was finally like you know what if not for any other reason than I am tired of repeating this Gettys Burger dress speech to every Wayward friend who calls me up about to consume really potent drugs I have some of those if you go to Seth stop blog and type advice for authors there are two posts with the same title cuz that's I wasn't being clear that I wrote a year and a half apart and they have each like a dozen or 15 bullet points and now I have a Sig and superum that I can call up if when someone sends me a note a friend or whatever I can say oh I've already thought about this question here you go oh I love it

        "  'transcript': \"right now I want you to notice Sensations in your back what does your back feel like right now the part that's usually painful yeah it feels relaxed right now good more relaxed yeah good good how would you rate the discomfort level right now on that's Z to thin [Music] scale [Music] David so nice to have you here thank you for making the time thank you so much for having me Tim and I want to say upfront that you're are a man of many talents in addition to hypnosis and the other things that people will get from your bio you are an expert in word play you came up with ostentatious as in Austin the city before we started recording and I had to write it down I was like if there's not a retail shop with that name there must be so I'm going to will that into existence at least put it out there somebody feel free to grab it okay and we'll start with a question which is not how you were exposed to hypnosis but how your father was exposed to hypnosis would you mind winding back the clock I'd be glad to it's a good psycho analytic thing to do I'm the child of not one but two psychiatrists and psychoanalysts both of my parents were and they told me that I was free to be any kind of psychiatrist I wanted to be so here I am my father was finishing his analytic training just at the beginning of World War II and so he enlisted in the Army he was a battalion surgeon and as he was getting off the couch his handlist actually said something to him he said herb would you like to get a course in hypnosis and my father was thinking what was wrong with my free associations you know is he trying to fix me some other way or something and his analyst said no there's a vienes refugee Nam Gustaf F schenberg who was a forensic psychiatrist in Austria he had a small poox scar right smack in the middle of his forehead and he noticed that as he's interviewing these prisoners suddenly their heads would sort of Nod they close their eyes and go into some kind of altered state so he got interested in hypnosis and was using it to help his prisoners and so he offered to teach Army docs how to use it so my father took this course from Dr Van schenberg and he used it to help soldiers deal with combat stress reactions to deal with pain uh the dinner table conversations were really interesting he told me a story of one guy who developed a conversion hysterical conversion paralysis he couldn't use his legs the guy said they just don't work I don't know what happened so my father asked him about the context and he said well we were ordered to retreat and I saw my best friend lying on the ground and I had to make a choice do I try and save him or do I follow orders so so I follow orders I feel terrible and you know maybe I could have saved him and so my father in hypnosis said I want you to look at your friend right now and I want you to notice something his boots are facing down and that means he's already gone and the guy said thank you doctor and he got up and walked wow that he was telling himself physiologically I should not have moved I should not have left him and when my father helped releve him of the guilt and you know most people who have been traumatized would rather feel guilty than helpless they'd rather find a way to blame themselves as as though they could replay the movie and it would come out differently and he was helping him face the fact that his his buddy was gone and there was likely nothing he could do to to stop it so I'd hear those kind of conversations at the dinner table and they were pretty interesting I got invited once to watch him treat a woman who had non eptic seizures so she who's your father my father so he's he's making a a teaching movie and he invited me to come and watch and he had her go back in hypnosis to the last time she had a seizure and her head starts to twist and shake and she's starting to have these convulsive movements and you know he said to me it's a lot easier to get people to start these symptoms than to stop them you know they've already tried to stop them it didn't work so the way you teach them how to control it is you teach them how to bring it on and then he had her practice making them milder and milder and milder and he cured her of her hysterical seizures how does she make them milder if you're triggering these events how do you ratchet down the intensity of say the convulsions how does your father coach someone through doing that it was kind of an inference you know it was sort of he he's basically nonverbally communicating that I'm not just going to put you through the same misery over and over again I'm going to try and show you how to manage it better MH and so he he taught her that if you can make it happen you can make it happen differently you can change the way it happens and you're not going to get all the hysterical reactions around it her husband had his workbench at his Factory put near the door so when she had another seizure he could rush out the door and go to her apartment and and help her that's how how much Panic it elicited so he he taught her that you can have this for whatever reason but it doesn't have to be as bad and over time the more she did it the more she kind of deconditioned the intensity of the seizures so we're going to get to definitions pretty quickly just in terms of what hypnosis is what it is not but first a few follow-up questions forensic psychiatrist I've seen these words separately but what is a forensic psychiatrist well I I do that in my copia spare time it's basically in those in those situations you work for an attorney not for the patient so you're you may assess the patient try and decide what's wrong with them but it's for the purposes of preparing a report for example some kind of emotional damage that was someone I was evaluating a woman who terrible situation in one of the recent forest fires where she's on the phone with her mother as the mother's home was burning down in one of these fires and it turned out that the community had not been adequately warned how bad this was going to be and even worse her boyfriend didn't want to be bothered to go pick up her mother so it was a very complicated emotional situation so I was evaluating what the emotional consequences were for her of losing her mom you're being brought in as a subject matter expert to determine the meritorious nature or lack thereof of this particular case okay or one of my favorite moments doing that I kind of have you know I like testifying at court because and I was being grilled by some attorney one day and I'm thinking this I'm enjoying this and then I thought you're crazy speak what are you what he's going after you and I said you know what compared to academic life this is simple your friend is the guy at that table and your enemy is the guy at that table and in Academia you never know where it's coming from so this lawyer is going after it was a case at the the United Parcel Service where a gunman who was an employee gone gone off came in with a bunch of guns in his pack got through a metal detector the guard was looking at his phone and not paying any attention and he started shooting 9 minutes later and I just said this is a horrible breach of prot if he's going to be checking people he ought to do something about it and even if he didn't want to confront the guy directly he could have called the police the police got there in 3 minutes when they were called it took the guy 9 minutes to get ready to start shooting it was a terrible thing so the the lawyer the defense lawyer did not like what I was saying and he said well Dr Spiegel you're not a security expert are you and I said no sir I'm more of an insecurity expert and I could hear the judge on the jury laughing and that cost him a lot of money that cost him a lot that cost him plenty so I I enjoy doing that on the side was it I think it was Kissinger who said I left Academia cuz I couldn't stand the politics something like yeah no he said the reason academics fight so bitterly is that the stakes are so low right right there we go thank you okay and the other question I had was you mentioned this gent I can't remember the there was a Von in there I can't remember the full name Von a shenberg Von a shenberg who had the small poox scar in the middle of his forehead and I think it was he who when he spoke with his patients noticed they were nodding off or transitioning into this altered state why were they entering that altered state was he doing it deliberately or was there some manner in which he was conducting these sessions that he ended up just correlating with that and he figured out it was caal what was it was more the latter it was more at first I mean later on he was doing formal inductions but what hypnosis is Tim is just a a heightened focus of attention it's like looking through a telephoto lens with a camera you get fully absorbed in the center of your awareness and things that ordinarily you'd be conscious of noises on the outside other things you dissociate you put outside of conscious awareness so it's a kind of and listening to his words they just tended to focus on the spot in his forehead and many hypnotic inductions involve some kind of visual Focus to narrow the focus of attention when Andrew huberman my friend and colleague was on your program he was talking about that the narrowing of attention just as the lens of the eye changes and limits the amount of information you get this kind of heightened focus on the center of attention so it changes your State of Consciousness as well how would you for for people who are listening and for me I'm listening glad to hear that differentiate hypnosis from say meditation concentration practice and meditation and also from what people might consider say a flow State and maybe they are the same when but when people have this this Focus to the exclusion of much else in these say sports contexts or other types of contexts if you could just delineate those three that would be very helpful so hypnosis has three main components I've already mentioned two highly focused attention or absorption dissociation putting outside conscious awareness things that are in Consciousness right now for example hopefully you're so interested in what I'm saying that you're not aware of the sensations of your feet touching the floor right now and if that if if you were we could just stop now but um so the more intensely focused you are the more things you got to put outside of awareness to keep from distracting you the third component and in some ways the most interesting in hypnosis is what you to be called suggestibility you know you'll do anything I say if I tell you to do it which is not exactly true but the truth in it is that you are more cognitively flexible so we've done some research aik fman my postto and I did a study looking at the continuous performance task in people who are high and low hypnotizables the task has subtle changes in the way you solve the problems you're solving but they don't tell you what it is so people who are more cognitively flexible will figure out quicker that the rules have changed and how you do it and that highly hypnotizable people are very good at that they're good at letting go of the old premise and hooking into the new one so that's a kind of cognitive flexibility that is very valuable and I think a key aspect of why hypnosis is so helpful in treatment and helps people just manage problems better so a question there just in terms of the reason that it helps people in a clinical context with various issues is it because the in a sense the errors of causality Point both ways in the sense that someone with this higher cognitive flexibility are better at letting go of say one premise and then taking on another but at the same time you can use hypnosis to make someone put someone into a state where they're more cognitively flexible and can kind of overwrite the previous premise is that yes yes you're right and but it's because you know all hypnosis is frankly self- hypnosis that is you don't need to watch somebody dangle a watch or or have a develop a small Puck car in their forehead people can shift into this state of Highly focused attention and when they do and one of the coolest things about the state is you tend to let go of your ordinary premises not just about what's going on at that moment but who you are what kind of a person you are and that's what scares people you know it's the stage show thing of the football coach dancing like a ballerina but there's a message there you know not that hypnosis is good to make people look silly it's that people can try out being different and see what it feels like they can let go of their usual premises and that's where hypnosis is something like Flow State chick sent me hi I I knew him no kidding okay and his point you know he calls Flo an autotelic experience it's one that is self-rewarding it feels good just to do it and hypnosis is like that when you get really absorbed in experience like you ever get so caught up in a good movie that you forget you're watching a movie or drawing especially I'll just yeah time just kind of vanishes when I'm in that state exactly exactly that's a self-hypnotic state and I'm I'm sure you're you're good at that and one of the ways in which I help athletes for example I I was asked to consult with the Stanford women swimming team they're terrific team a lot of the women wind up in the Olympics but the coach noticed that they were doing better in practice than they were in meets their time was better and thinking what the hell's going on here well swimming is not a contact sport and so the only person you're really competing with is yourself and what the women were doing was distracting themselves by paying attention to the women in the lane on either side instead of being in touch with their own bodies getting into a flow state by saying how do I move through the water how do I connect with my muscles how do I coordinate them that we were being distracted from that and so I got them in hypnosis to get into more of a flow state to focus not on the outcome but the process and that's a key thing for athletes in golf and basketball tiger you know trained with hypnosis he had a caddy who was helping him with hypnosis I've helped golfers do that there are a number of major basketball players who do it as well and it's a way of not worrying about whether you're going to hit the basket or not but what you need to do in your body to make the connection to do what you want to do and so hypnosis is like a flow State it's something that you just get in it to enjoy the feeling of doing it and how you relate to your body and by the way good things can happen mhm when you do it if you were using let's just say a concentration practice in meditation whether that be something like Transcendental Meditation with a mantra or thinking of a candle flame or fill-in the blank would that qualify as a subset of self hypnosis or are there differences that you'd want to highlight no they're different Tim because in in mindfulness you're engaged in a somewhat different practice it's open presence you're just you're not judging you're not evaluating you're just letting feelings and thoughts flow through you mhm and people learn to do it with great discipline over time but it doesn't come naturally you don't lose yourself in it the way you lose yourself in a movie now eventually some people do but as you know from having considerable experience with it it takes training and it's a it's a struggle whereas the funny thing about hypnosis is boy if people are hypnotizable they're in it just like that even if they've never formally done it before if you're hypnotizable you just do it so it it's a kind of natural shift in attention narrowing the focus that leads you along and gets you engaged in a flow-like experience whereas with meditation you're you have open presence you do a body scan you cultivate compassion they're all important things but it's about being rather than doing whereas hypnosis is more doing than being in hypnosis you do it for a purpose you do it to control pain to manage stress you get to sleep to stop smoking to eat more sensibly so it's it's more intense it's briefer and it does emphasize the development of absorption and flow MH great thank you now if someone is highly hypnotizable how do you determine hypnotizability and I do have the eye roll test in my notes which I've never done yeah so I was curious if if that is just one of a portfolio of techniques that you use or if that is a dominant test how do you determine if someone to what degree someone is hypnotizable well hypnotizable is a very stable trait most 8-year-olds are in transes most of the time as you know if you call your 8-year-old in for dinner he doesn't hear you you know he's doing this thing work can player all the same thing for kids I don't know why we try to train to be little adults because they have so much fun yeah but as we go through adolescence P talked about developing formal operations in adolescence where you begin to privilege reason over experience MH some of us lose some of that hypnotizability you don't get as easily absorbed in things you have to think them through logically first by the time you're about 21 your hypnotizability becomes as stable a tradeit as IQ and there was a study done at Stanford they did a 25-year blind followup to former psych one students who'd been had hypnotizability measured and the test retest correlation was7 okay now that's that's better than IQ I mean that's really something so and and in general what happens is they get divided into one of three groups the people we call the poets highly hypnotizable they still get totally absorbed in movies and caught up in things that's about 20% about 60% are we call them the diplomats they'll have the experience and then they'll think about it and negotiate it and then go back and try it a little more and go back and forth and there's 20% we call the researchers who just aren't very hypnotizable the researchers yeah yeah but they can benefit from techniques inv employing hypnosis because you learn to focus on what you're for not what you're against you don't fight a problem you find a way to master it by joining it and focusing on a a positive resolution a self-reinforcing resolution of it so hypnotizability we know what's going on in the brain we've we've taken high and low hypnotizes put them in the functional MRI scanner and there's an interesting thing that happens only in the highly hypnotizable people and that is functional connectivity that is when one region is active the other region is active between the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex MH which is part of the executive control Network the one I'm hopefully using now talking to you and and the dorsal anterior singulate now the singulate cortex is like the C on its ends in the middle of the brain and the dorsal front part is part of our salience Network the alarm system system it's the thing that if you hear a loud noise you know it distracts you it turns that's so the salience network is coordinated in highly hypnotizable people with the executive control Network and that makes sense if they're working together it's easier to lose yourself in an activity and not worry about whether you should be doing something else we've actually found also that there's a genetic component to that that there's a particular polymorphism of the gene that metabolizes dopamine cacal ometh transfer and if you happen to have the methine veiling version of it you have moderate metab metabolic rate which keeps pretty high and stable levels of dopamine in the brain and those people are more hypnotizable than those who are homozygous for either methine intervein I had a brilliant young graduate student Dana CAD who actually developed a point of care genetic test for hypnotizability so you can take a drop of blood and in a in a couple of minutes we can tell how hypnotizable you're likely to be but we also have a test called the hypnotic induction profile that my late father and I developed that it gives you like a six-minute hypnotic experience have your hand float up in the air if you pull it down will it float right back up do you experience a loss of control in that hand do you respond to the signal ending that experience do you have a sense of floating lightness or buoyancy so you get a score from 0 to 10 and that is likewise a very stable trait it's something I have used with every one of the 7,000 people I've used hypnosis within my career and it helps me have a sort of common experience that is not initially connected to treatment but just we both can see how much they can respond and a it gives me useful information B it gives them useful information and see we're not blaming the victim here if somebody is not hypnotizable it's not because they're resisting because most people aren't they're paying good money to see me and get help and and it's not because I'm not good at what I'm doing because I've learned something about it although my first psychoanalytic supervisor said yes she didn't go into a trance despite having had 200 shock treatments because you're a lousy hypnotist and I said I don't think so so it but but it's nice because it makes it a neutral experience M it's one in which you try out and see what it's like and they learn from it and I learn from it where does the iroll test stand in terms of a reliable indicator well the iroll test is like a good initial guest it's moderately correlated with formally measured hypnotizability and my father discovered this he he was using eye fixation on a light on the ceiling of his office and he noticed that the the woman I mentioned who you know had the hysterical pseudo seizures he noticed that when he asked her to look up at that light and then close her eyes her eyes all he saw was the whites of her eyes they stayed up and the after he made that movie that day the following Monday he had one of the most obsessional men he'd ever seen and he had the guy look up and he could not keep his eyes up as he was closing the eyelids they came down and all he saw is his Iris as they they close their eyes so he began measuring that and it turned out you can score people from Z to four and how much they're able to dissociate lowering the eyelid with lowering the eye and that is an initial interesting indication of hypnotizability so if you want a quick five second test let do it here it is love 5-sec test so look up past your eyebrows all the way up high way way up and as you keep looking up slowly close your eyes look up close oh yeah oh yeah yeah you're a three to four you're in the upper end because you keep your eyes way up and I can barely see your iris as you start to close your eyes great well another option on the menu then yeah you bet and do you have any hypothesis for why those are correlated yes eye movements are very much related to level of Consciousness I mean the obvious thing is you close your eyes when you go to sleep MH uh drugs that affect the ey and ey movements are related to autonomic arousal your pupils get big when your you know your sympathetic nervous system is going on small when you're on opioids for example the third fourth and sixth cranial nerve nuclei is surrounded in the brain stem by the reticular activating system which is part of our arousal Network MH and so things that affect eye movements tend to affect arousal as well and so we think it's an ability to shift gears inhibit peripheral awareness and intensify your focus and that this is just it's no accident that it's the same parts of the brain that regulate arousal and eye movement that are associated with this eye rle this is a side alley question we're going to come back to the mainstream in a second but I'm very curious do you have a do you have an opinion of EMDR I do and you could just explain for folks what that sure is I'm from New York I'm I'm not devoid of opinions fellow New Yorker here so all right here we go here we go strap in folks the emdr's IM movement desensitization and reprocessing Francine Shapiro developed this and it's a widely used technique the VA uses it a lot to help people with trauma and hypnotic like techniques are very helpful with trauma and I'll be glad to talk about that but her idea was that somehow you facilitated communication between the hemispheres if if you had people move their eyes back and forth while they were discussing a traumatic experience now the certainly good idea in this is that we now know more and more that reexposure under controlled conditions to traumatic memories is in itself therapeutic so exposure therapy and cognitive re restructuring are two very prominent ways of helping people deal with trauma and EMDR has components of that and you know if you think about it is it anything like hypnosis well you know what was the oldest way of inducing hypnosis right remember the dangling watches you know what are your eyes doing when you know you're moving back and forth moving back and forth so I think there's a lot that's hypnotic in EMDR but to tell you the truth every study that has has deconvoluted eye movements from everything else that goes on in the MDR has shown that the eye movements don't have much to do with it and toward the end of her career Francine Shapiro stopped doing she then did tapping rather than eye movements and other things but it's not at all clear to me that the actual eye movements have anything much to do with the outcome so it's another therapeutic technique but I have to say that my overall impression is that what's good about it isn't new and what's new about it isn't good so what are the ingredients in EMDR aside from discussing the traumatic event are there other characteristics or elements that contribute to outcomes when they are good I don't know if this has been studied in any struct way yes it it is been used I mean the VA has used it extensively in helping combat vets with post-traumatic stress disorder and the fact that you you summon up a traumatic event and then you picture it you are become aware of the emotions that come uh along with it can be a component of effective Psychotherapy I think the two things that matter the most and what I do when I use hypnosis in treating PTSD is number one the control with which you summon it I've always wondered if if exposure therapy works so well why don't flashbacks cure PTSD I mean flashbacks are symptoms of pts you're reliving the event as though it were happening again and the difference I think is that there's no control you feel reattached by the memory the way you did the trauma MH and so I think with EMDR like other psychotherapies like exposure therapies cognitive reframing therapies you in a controlled sit situation bring up a traumatic memory so it's not hitting you again from out of nowhere you're saying I'm going to spend some time thinking about this now so you're doing it in an element of control that was completely absent when the trauma happened that was just done to you this is something you're doing to yourself in a controlled way with the prospect of a direct benefit the second thing is cognitive restructuring is is helping you to see an old problem from a new point of view to understand it differently I was treating a California road worker who was in a construction zone when some idiot went the wrong way and hit him with a car he was taking arrest on his right it was two days before his wedding he had bad ankle fracture um he had just pushed himself out of the way as the car was coming and he was miserable you know and his his fiance was miserable and he just thought how why didn't I see this coming and time and again if I had a nickel for every traumatized person either sexual assault or physical assault that that blame themselves for events they didn't control you know what's that guilt versus helplessness guilt versus helplessness that's exactly right and I I had him relive it in hypnosis I said let's go through this and he said I'm sitting on the thing having my lunch and suddenly I realized that he's not going the way all the other cars were going he's coming at me and I just pushed myself away from a barrier next to me and fell forward and that's when he hit my leg and I said I want you to look at this what would have happened if you hadn't done that he said well he would have HD me dead on you know and I said so you saved your life you know so it's tragic it's a terrible thing that happened but it could have been so much worse so think about this not just from what went wrong but from what went right what you did to help yourself and he felt entirely different about the trauma after that you know he was still unhappy about his leg being injured but it's a way of restructuring your point of view about the problem and that's where techniques in including hypnosis for trauma can help people really change their perspective mhm the other thing that happens in hypnosis is the more you concentrate use your prefrontal cortex the less activity in the default mode Network now that's the part of the brain the posterior singulate that's involved with self-reflection and self- understanding and when you're not doing much but thinking about yourself and who you are you've got a lot of activity going on in the default mode and if you can in hypnosis turn that down you can try out being different instead of seeing that this as just a total failure and disaster that messed up your wedding and all kinds of things you can see it as evidence that you had to wethal in a matter of a split second to do something that saved your life so it changes your view of yourself and who you are and that's one of the terrific things about hypnosis is it allows you to try out being different see what it feels like so feel free to fact check this but I've had a lot of involvement with say MDMA assists therapy for ptsc and all the way through phase three trials and so on and have also through my Foundation funded a lot of basic science and some clinical work related to different psychedelic assisted therapies for say treatment resistant depression or major depressive disorder in the case of ocyon and the default mode Network and this type of not quite deactivation but sort of down regulation I'm not sure what the proper technical term would be is something that Rob and carart Harris talks a lot about right predominantly out of Imperial College London and then later at UCSF and it's striking because the subjective reports in a lot of these experiences whether it be in the MDMA assisted Psychotherapy although I don't really consider MDMA psychedelic for various reasons but let's just use Pyon or even LSD the ability to take a sort of impartial Observer status on yourself and to assume New Perspective Ives the description that I'm paraphrasing here but that you just share it is very similar to the subjective reports of people who get who have good therapeutic out comes with these other modalities so it's exciting to me to hear you describe it in that way because psychedelics are contraindicated for so many people there there quite a few people who should not take psychedelics in any form what are the I do want to talk about some of the applications but in terms of risk profile I mean usually the kind of magnitude of potential impact is correlated to some type of risk profile are there Adverse Events there are but before I get to that let me just backtrack a little bit on on MDMA and psilocybon for PTSD because a lot of the things that the psychedelics have in common although some are more hallucinogenic and others like psilocybin m is what's been called ego dissolution and that you seem to just suppress activity in the default mode Network right and so it becomes a kind of non-judgmental awareness where you see it happens but you're sort of disconnected from it so breast cancer patients dying of breast cancer have done very well with psilocybin trips now I've for years worked with women who are dying of breast cancer I know what it's like mhm and what struck me as similar and interesting is that they can one one of my group therapy patients said that looking at death in the group is like looking into the grand canion when you were afraid of heights you know if you fell down it would be a disaster but you feel better about yourself because you're able to to look at it I can't say I feel Serene but I can look at it so it's this odd kind of Detachment where you can see it and what they think about their death now is I still don't like the idea of dying but what I can see now is what a miracle it is that I ever got to live at all and so they see the same thing from two different perspectives so this ability to to sort of disconnect yourself fo and in hypnosis it's a rapid suspension of your usual selfhood in psychedelic work it's more this ego dissolution it kind of dissolves so it's a a quicker reversible and form of something similar which is playing with who you are and what you are and that has tremendous therapeutic possibilities now I think one reason MDMA works so well with PTSD is because it's the sort of human connection drug you know and these Raves and everything people suddenly feel connected with people they never even know or feel very different about their loved ones and how they connect with them people who have been traumatized who at PTSD feel deep shame and it's not because they've done anything wrong but just to be treated like an object like a thing is humiliating and so to be able to relive it in a state where you're feeling different about who you are is a way of reprocessing and disconnecting from the sense of Shame just saying yes it happened I don't like it but it's not the bottom line about me mhm and that's where depression with post-traumatic stress disorder are so harmful to people because it tarnishes their feeling about who they are as people and if you can understand the experience but disconnect it in some ways from this default mode conclusion about what sort of a person you are that can be powerfully therapeutic absolutely the commonalities are really worth highlighting here because certain treatments are not accessible to to some folks and which is also part of the reason why I'm so interested in the work that is being pioneered in part by our mutual friend Nolan Williams yes at Stanford Nolan's terrific we'll probably come back to Nolan and accelerate TMs in in a second but what are the risks if any with hypnosis there are very few I'll tell you when we started Ry about 3 years ago I was kind of worried cuz you know 30 years ago I would not have dared to put an interactive digital hypnosis app out there on the web and just see what happened to people you know I worried that people would have all kinds of ab reactions and dissociative reactions and terrible things could happen but I thought what the hell I I want people to have access to this and be able to try it and we've had like three4 of a million downloads and the number of potential problems we've have is less than 10 and none of them are serious yeah you know some of them are ecstatic positive experiences kind of like you know psychedelic ones most of them are you know periods of anxiety or stress that are easily reversible and so the good thing about hypnosis is you can turn it on real fast you can turn it off real fast so the worst thing that happens most of the time is sometimes it doesn't work so what so you do something else right so compared to the side effects of drugs like let's take opioids for example where last year 88,000 Americans died of opioid overdoses and almost all of them were not suicides they were just inadvertent overdoses of opioids hypnosis has not yet succeeded in killing anyone it's just not dangerous and the reason you're using that as example is because of the intersection with pain management you bet okay so we'll also come back to that got it marker noted so adverse sort of risk profile pretty low adverse event profile pretty manageable I want to come back to Nolan for a second because I'm wondering if someone is in the researcher 20% so low responder is there because I do believe that Nolan mentioned this to me the possibility of using something like accelerated TMS which is transcranial magnetic stimulations is a type of brain stimulation to improve trait hypnotizability I don't know what the trait as a modifier means but is it possible that one could use a tool like accelerate TMS to improve their response to hypnosis yes the answer is absolutely yes and and Nolan and I and aik fireman and a number of other members of Nolan's team just published a paper in nature mental health in which we took high and low hypnotizable we took hypnotize people who were less than highly hypnotizable and we administered to them either accelerated TMS to the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex with the idea of regulating activity in the dorsal anterior singulate using real versus sham TMS so we could tell whether they got actually got the TMS or not they couldn't tell the the paddle made the same noise but they didn't know and we were able to transiently significantly increase hypnotizability in the ones who got the real TMS and not in the ones who got the Sham what was the dosing on that was it one day was it five sessions yeah no it was it was one day it was just one session and then single session single session oh yeah it was not repeated like the treatment of or suicide liation single session okay that seems like so we're hoping that's right I can see your face lighting up I feel the same way that we may be able to like for people we were studying people with fibromyalgia people with chronic pain to enhance their hypnotizability and then use it to treat pain which it is very effective for okay I'm going to get to pain quickly folks I promise and this is the segue the segue is different tools show their best results in different contexts right so you might have something like PRP PL rich plasma for certain types of injury repair surgical recovery better for some types of surgeries and Joints than others you might have fill in- the blank MDMA assisted Psychotherapy for instance better for certain indications like complex PTSD than others for instance uh other things might be better suited to say alcohol use disorder what is hypnosis best for where have you seen the most outstanding results compared to other options we've seen excellent results in helping people to manage stress we're we're finding with revery that about 80% of people within 10 minutes feel a significant reduction in their stress levels it helps people focus intensify their focus of attention plan what they want to do and then do it it's a skill that they can learn to use very quickly it's very effective with pain that's one of the oldest uses of hypnosis with pain in fact there was a British surgeon named esdale who went to India and was using hypnosis this was pre ether anesthesia you know they would just you get people drunk have them bite on a block of wood hold them down and out cut on them Frontier medicine Frontier medicine right and he went to India and he reported 80% surgical anesthesia with hypnosis and when 10 years later at Mass General you just don't want to be in the 20% no you don't but it's better better than better than what was happening before better than bourbon in a wallet right exactly and when ether was first introduced at Mass General 10 years later the surgeon stroe to the front of the amphitheater to say gentlemen this is no humbug to distinguish ether from hypnosis well they were getting 90% anesthesia and so esdale withdrew his paper he said well they're doing 10% better ether was getting 90 and hypnosis was getting 80 yeah I got to so he withdrew his paper he withdrew his paper and you know it's taken us like a century and a half to figure out that the brain actually has something to do with pain processing yeah and there are studies now showing which part of the brain just changing the words you use in hypnosis which part of the brain is involved in the analgesia so you significantly reduce pain in the C meta sensory cortex if you say your the hand that's receiving the shocks is cool tingling a numb filter that hurt out of the pain you get the same reduction in pain response if you say well the pain is there but it won't bother you so much sort of like opioids then you return down activity in the dorsal anterior singulate so you can see different parts of the brain involved in pain processing and then hypnotic aneres depending on the language you're using depending on the language so if you think doctors say to patients right it is spellcasting that's right but no pointy hats or anything yeah those come at the more advanced levels that's right got a payer Association do is to get the hats right so how does that affect the treatment if you're looking at say the example that you just gave where different wording is affecting different neuroanatomical structures and activity yeah does that then determine your neurot targeting for lack of a better term and you're like okay we saw a instead of B light up we want we really want to go after a based on what we know well it may be for certain kinds of pain or certain kinds of problems you want to emphasize one or the other but frankly you know whever we app we have four different sets of instructions that involve either just going somewhere else taking your leaving your body here and going to a desert island and enjoying things or imagining a physical remedy that actually reduces pain a warm bath or or an ice bath or something like that or move the pain around see what it feels like to do that and one other technique that's very helpful is teach people to have compassion for their bodies this is like mindfulness in some ways but you know if your body were a three-year-old child who'd been hurt would you get frustrated and angry with it hell no what would you do that everybody says I'd give him a hug and I'd stroke him and I'd try and make them feel better so there are different language techniques we can use to get the same effect which is to significantly reduce pain and we have randomized clinical trials that prove that hypnotic analgesia works at much lower levels of medication too and so it's an underutilized resource hypnosis is like an underappreciated company that you know hasn't been managed well and has a lot more positive resources and that's what it's like we just don't take advantage of it so let's use me as a hypothetical Intrepid user of self- hypnosis so I have some low back pin we we were chatting about this before we started recording is there a particular approach that you might recommend one or in this case I start with in a case like this sure yeah we can try if you want yeah Dum game your game absolutely game all right how would you rate your pain right now on a 0 to 10 scale I'd say it's a two out of 10 it's it's more of a a bothersome sff yeah and is there a physical remedy that helps you with it a warm bath there are foam rolling say the like performers and glutes and so on does help using so as release tends to help just laying on my stomach honestly with my hands under my pelvis m M to take all the activity out of the spinal Erectors helps mhm okay those are a few things like laying down on my stomach and breathing into the back to relax the spinal Erectors I would say is one thing that seems to help well that seems like a vivid image and temperature things don't make much difference they temperature if I do say a cold a cold bath and then a hot bath just contrast therapy like that that seems to help okay that feeling of cold tissue vasod dilating when I get into the hot bath that type of like prickly sensation of being sort of perfused with blood that that's something I associate I would say with feeling better feeling better so part of what you're doing is reinterpreting the signals you're getting in a different way so let's try it if you want see so get as comfortable as you can on one please do one thing look up all the way up high as you can two do two things slowly close your eyes and take a deep breath and three do three things let the breath out let your eyes relax but keep them closed and let your body float imagine you're floating somewhere safe and comfortable like a bath a lake a hot tub or floating in space and then take your right hand and stroke the back of your left hand starting with the tip of your left middle finger my or you can put it on on the table that might be better now stroke the back of your left middle finger down along the back of your left hand past your wrist to your elbow and as you do that that's good develop a sense of tingling and numbness and lightness and let your left hand float up in the air like a balloon feel the tingling that's good and let it float up you bend your your elbow and you can rest your arm lightly on the table and please describe what physical Sensations you're aware of now in your left hand and arm feel my heartbeat in my palm mhm okay little bit of I can feel the hair on the back of my arm touching the sleeve that I rolled up good and I'm going to give you this instruction if you pull your hand back down to the table with your right hand and then let go it will float right back up to the upright position just see what happens that's good so you're putting it down now let go I see you smiling what's happening well there's h i mean it feels like it's floating number one I'm also kind of second guessing myself cuz I wonder if I'm doing this to conform to the exercise if that makes sense but it feels like it's floating okay yeah and as you do that let your left hand remain upright later when I ask you to touch your left elbow with your right hand and then let go your usual sensation and control will return okay right now I want you to notice Sensations in your back what does your back feel like right now the part that's usually painful yeah it feels relaxed right now good more relaxed yeah good good how would you rate the discomfort level right now on that 0 to 10 scale five 1 out of 10 one out of 10 105 to 1 okay good so already notice how you've been able to change sensation not just in a neutral part of your body your left hand and arm but in a part that has been problematic I want you to imagine now that you're lying on your belly maybe with a roll under you and feel a pleasant tingling numbness in your lower back as if it were cooler or warmer or you were changing it from warmer to cooler feel a pleasant tingling numbness and let it filter the hurt out of the pain each breath deeper and easier now again with your eyes closed and remaining in the state of concentration please describe how your body is feeling right now how my body is feeling yeah it does feel cooler good feels a little dissociated uhuh makes sense like can you describe that a little more what did I describe to the dissociation mhm feel like it's very similar to two two two kilas or there you go or low dose of of ketamine which I don't recommend but I mean as a dissociative anesthetic I've always struggled to put words to the dissociative experience MH there's a lightness and there's a conscious awareness of the body without being as identified with the body exactly so you can observe it but it feels different MH and would it be fair to say that it's not as annoying as it usually is it's not as annoying good so notice how you're able to filter a lot of the discomfort and displeasure out of the usual pain situation by detaching from it mhm by experiencing it differently it's not uh kind of a sentence you have to endure it's a sensation your body is giving you that you can interpret in different ways now for people who might wonder if this is compartmentalizing in a way that is long-term harmful I'm not saying that's what it is but mhm is this just taking a different Vantage Point how would you encourage them to think about this yes I would say it's reinterpreting the sensations and signals that you're getting from that part of your body and you're uncoupling them from the usual sense of annoyance and limitation that tends to actually make it worse oh it 100% makes it worse yeah and instead you're saying okay it's there I don't like it but it's not bad and that capacity to reframe to reprocess the signal is a powerful way of better managing pain you're filtering the hurt out of the pain now please take your right hand and touch your left elbow and then let go and see what happens to your left hand and arm yeah just more movement is more forthcoming uhhuh good that's that's surprising isn't it yeah I was noticing how like my my fingers got kind of got frozen in this position I thought that was interesting not not making too much out of it but I was like H all right you can let it float back down now and how's your left-handed arm feeling now normal normal good normal so you were able to change sensation in both directions and how's your lower back feeling now feels really good actually yeah so terrific that's I'm very glad that's great so thank you for that you're welcome where do you get my [Applause] bill right you have my email what is this I'm really glad fresh books $6,000 what happened to the first one's always free oh wait no that's drug dealing not hypnosis yeah exactly and if someone's inducing that from a self- hypnosis perspective but let's just talk about it could be in the context of Ry it could be in a different context what are the steps that they take or how do they self-induce for something like that let's just say if I wanted to do that five minutes a day if I wanted to do it five minutes a day you could remember what I told you or you could queue up the pain control app on rivy and you get to hear my malous voice teaching you and exercise good use of mifl right this dlet tones dlet tones there you are to teach you how to do this and you could follow along and it's interactive so I'll ask you is your hand floating if it is I'll tell you one thing if not it's something else so it's a branch chain kind of response that I tried to make as much like being across the table or in my office MH as I could and not to beat the dead horse of neurobiology but just to reinforce my understanding from a neurobiological or neuroanatomical perspective what is happening so what's happening is and we've got EEG studies we've got fmri studies we've got pet studies showing that what's happening if you think about it that pain is a always a combination of peripheral input through the lateral spinothalamic tract through the thalamus through the per aqueductal gray and up to the cementos sensory cortex with input from the salian network so if you just broke your arm the San never was going God you're in trouble you better do something but the problem is because we're fairly pathetic physical creatures we have to take very good care of our fragile bodies and so we have a brain that is designed to help you recognize when you're hurt and get help and manage the pain but for example freeze not necessarily move so a predator could detect you more easily so pain is a combination of those peripheral signals coming in and what your brain decides is wrong and what to do about it and so very often chronic pain is really not anything you to do anything about but your brain often treats it as if it were acute pain here I am and so it derails you and it annoys you and it keeps you from doing what you want to do and the more annoying it is the more attention you pay to it it's like the noisy kid in the classroom you know and so you can learn to modulate that so we showed in one experiment with Stanford students we gave them electric shocks we measured somea of sensory evoked responses so you can see waveforms coming out up to a second after the shocks are administered and in the hypnosis condition we were able to stop the p100 the First Response cold there was no response of the brain when they were in hypnosis in the first tenth of a second and the p200 and p300 were half as big as ordinarily So within a fraction of a second the brain is processing the signals differently and as I mentioned there are studies that show you can turn out activity in the anterior singul you can turn out activity in some other sensory cortex so the brain is saying this is not as bad as I initially thought it was and I don't have to pay as much attention to it it doesn't have to hurt me as much because very often we amplify pain rather than diminish it by being so annoyed that it's happening and another thing that we know is going on in the brain is the interior singulate is rich in Gaba receptors gab aminobutyric acid their inhibitory neurotransmitter highly hypnotizable people have more binding of Gaba in the interior singular than low hypnotizable people so they can use it to be their own little drug dispensaries to inhibit the anxiety reaction in the dorsal anterior singular cortex so there are many understandable neurophysiological Ways by which the brain can literally take the strain out of pain also wondering I mean you'd have to test this of course but if hypnotizability as assessed by various means whe whether it's the eye roll test or a drop of blood and looking at the genetic profile if there might be some correlation to high response sort of Baseline response low response for psychedelic assisted treatments as well because as it stands currently there's a lot of shooting in the dark I'm not aware of any assessment that determines if someone is likely to be a high responder to psychedelic treat but as we're talking about it there seem to be a lot of parallels oh I think there are it wouldn't be that hard to it wouldn't be that hard to test I mean somebody has to fund it of course science takes money but there are lots of Assessments for let's just say determining the strength of a mystical experience and how that's correlated to therapeutic outcomes right highly correlated it turns out at least with psilocybin and so on and so forth they're all the standard assessments that you might have for depression and hamd and so on or Gad or whatever all these various things but in terms of determining in the process of patient recruitment who might be a high responder that's a that's a huge deficit in the system right now I agree with you I be a terrific thing to do and maybe in Nolan's next he just published a paper onum ibigan with astounding results I mean astonishing you know not not just improving PTSD which I kind of expected but TBI TBI traumatic brain injuries and it stays down goes down and it stays down yeah it's very durable and that's one of the things about a lot of these psychedelic studies is that it breaks the whole the whole model of you know keep occupying that receptor and you know blocking serotonin uptake and all this stuff and it's just once or twice and the brain is like reset it's rebooted yeah and that's where I think this interaction with the default mode network activity is very interesting because I think people reset their expectations of who they are what they are and what their symptoms mean in a way that lasts h of course there's often psychotherapeutic assistance with the Psychedelic treatments which is important but some of that could be hypnotic instruction too and I don't think much of that has been done but it would be very interesting to do I I agree with you it would be super interesting yeah there's a broad canvas still remaining for all sorts of research I'm glad to hear that so let me ask about a few things first you used wording that was along the lines of I heard you mentioned at least twice filter ing the hurt from the pain am I getting this right right could you elaborate on that and then the second piece is much earlier you were referring to the say I don't want to call them below hypnotizable people who fall into this category nickname the researcher who could still use it and I thought I heard you say something like framing issues is for us not against us something like that so could you first talk about filter the hurt from the pain and then this for us versus against us well the filter to hurt from the pain is you know it sounds kind of paradoxical what are you talking about pain hurts you know but the degree to which it hurts has to do with more than just the signal traveling through the lateral spinothalamic tract it has to do with how you interpret that signal we have all kinds of somatic signals some of which could be on the verge of discomfort some of which aren't and our brain's job is to interpret them and decide what to do about them Y and and so you can have a signal that doesn't necessarily automatically convey that something is wrong with the body it may be just an intense ceiling you know it's like the the difference between you know an enthusiastic hug and a squeeze that hurts and there's a line in there somewhere where that you cross and it's pretty obvious but there's also an area of interpretation you know or the ostentatious long hug there are a lot of guys here who do long hugs they say I'm a hugger when you try to shake hands yeah like 20 second hug there's a point where it gets uncomfortable it gets uncomfortable that's right and it's usually after the first second or two but and so the brain is doing its interpretive job of making meaning out of the sensory experience one of the other things that we know happens in the brain with hypnosis is higher functional connectivity between the dorsal prefrontal cortex and the insula insul is this little island that means Island in Latin in the mid front part of the brain that is a Mind Body conduit so it's a place where the brain controls what's happening in the body how much gastric acid you secrete your set of your autonomic arousal for example and also it receives information interoception from the body how is the body reacting to things and hypnosis intensifies this connection and intensifies coordinated activity between the the executive control Network and the insulin and so it's a way in which the brain can intensify its reading and understanding and interpretation of what's happening in the body and so you know athletes who are pushing their bodies to do things that most of the rest of us would say ouch you know I can't do this are interpreting that as I'm pushing my body as hard and as far as I can to get what I want and so they will interpret things that everyday people would interpret as putting yourself through pain as training know doing what you need to do and you know that runers high is in part composed of signals that many of us would just consider painful and so that's part of what the brain does and that's part of what hypnosis helps us to regulate and control how much of it is pain and how much it is not and so the interpretation of pain the meaning of it has a lot to do with how much it hurts and what about the the for US versus against us yes so the idea there is that people who are experienced with hypnosis that is people who know that people actually listen and respond to what you say will say the dumbest thing you can say to somebody is don't think about purple elephants right what are you going to think about and the best way to change behavior is intermittent positive reinforcement so you want the process of change to be what chick sent me high called autotelic you want to feel good about doing it so an example where we do that in hypnosis and where even non hypnotizable people can respond is when I try to teach someone how to stop smoking which was the first experiment we did with Ry I don't say you know cigarettes will taste terrible my my professor at medical school did that he you know your cigarettes will tastes like horseshit and the guy lit up the cigarette and said oh thank you doctor it's and he got a franic call two hours later he says doc my house smells terrible my house smells like hor right and and hacket said well are you smoking he said no but I forgot to tell you that my wife is a smoker so we had to hypnotize him and say only your cigarette you know it doesn't work you focus on what you're for respect and protect your body for my body smoking is a poison I need my body to live I owe my body respect and protection you would never put Tarin nicotine filled smoke in your baby's lungs your body is as dependent on you as your baby was so treat your body with the same respect you give a child and so you're focusing not on whether you have an urge to smoke or not whether you feel better are we on nicotine or not but whether you are going to commit to respect and protect your body and that way you can feel good from the moment you make the commitment to do it I'm being a good parent to my own body so even people who aren't hypnotizable can get that concept and say I'm not going to worry about my urge I there I have lots of urges I don't act on I don't have to act on this one just because I have it so I had one alcoholic who I was trying to use that to help him stop his drinking he said Oh you mean sort of like the body is the Temple of the soul and I said yes you got it that's it and he stopped drinking he so it's a matter of finding a way to formulate the resolution of a problem so that you start feeling good from the moment you commit to doing it before you know that you're going to stop smoking and we're we're getting one out of five people stop just like that you know and they surprise themselves that's one of the things I love about working with hypnosis is people are surprised at what they can do because they're trying out being different and seeing what it feels like what do you think is happening with the addiction specifically whether it's nicotine alcohol or other why does this work where other things fail and I should ask actually just so you can set the table for this how does hypnosis compare and I'm sure it depends on the practitioner and so on which kind of gets into a whole separate question I wanted to ask about just schools of hypnosis I don't know how standardized things are like CBT for instance right not that that's hypnosis I'm just saying they've tried to standardize so they can track things right how does hypnosis compare to other types of interventions for addiction the results we get with hypnosis is about one and four one out of five people just flat out stop and the rest cut down by about 50% and how much they're smoking that's roughly comparable to the use of Verena cleaner buproprion or nicar red patches uh it's not very different depends on the population but it's about as good is it the same people I don't know for sure cuz they're done in different contexts but it's not bad mhm I have people who are surprised by how easy they just I just it's they said like you know a lever was pulled and I just don't worry about it anymore I just don't think about it now does it happen with everyone no but every time we feel good anytime we get anybody to stop the most reversible cause of cancer in in the world is cigarette smoking so anybody get that's a good thing and it is correlated with hypnotizability so more hypnotizable people are more likely to stop using this approach but there are some non- hypnotizable people who do too because they get the concept even if they don't get the feeling that comes along with it and the other thing that keeps in mind in addiction medicine is that the odd thing is that it's not actually the high from the drug that hooks people it's the chase is better than the catch M so you get more misol limic dop dopamine secreted when you're in going through a scenario of scoring a drug than when you're actually taking the drug so it's the anticipation of pleasure that really gets to people and from my point of view using hypnosis that's fertile ground for intervention where you just say I can make you feel good without chasing after the drug I can make you feel good the way you felt when you hugged your six-month-old child because you're doing the same thing with your body now and that's a good thing so helping people to focus on what they're for is a a crucial part of the therapeutic strategy and makes it work what is the oldest that you're aware of documentation of hypnosis or something resembling hypnosis you know I was in Bali watching trans healers and the difference in Bali and this has gone on for thousands of years is they go into a trans and their patients watch them so they kind of go into this altered state and start chanting and singing and the idea is if you watch it is kind of hypnotic and you'll kind of go along with them but from a western point of view it started in the late 18th century with FR Anton Mesmer who was a viese physician hence mesmerized mesmerized that's right and he called it animal magnetism and he thought it actually had to do with changing the magnetic field in a patient's body and he had them look at tubs filled with iron filings and he had a magnet in fact the the magic wand in magic shows comes originally from a magnetic Rod that was used T 1.0 yeah that's right that's right from from animal magnetism to transcranial magnetic stimulation that's right and he was very popular he left his wife and family in Vienna he moved to Paris he was out competing the leading French Physicians of the day voler wrote to his brother we did everything we could to say father's life we even sent the doctors away and if you think about the major treatment at the time in France it was blood lighting France was the world's leading exporter of leeches and unless you happen to have congested part France was the world's leading exporter of leeches leeches because that's how they didn't yep and they still in some like hand damage things they use leeches to to suck blood out of certain regions in the hand and all that but at the time that was the major treatment and he was so popular and the cool thing I if you read about what his his office was like it was cheerful it was brightly lit patients would hang around all day boasting about what they' done with animal magnetism and the typical French Physician's office was truly Grim it was dark no decorations on the wall patients were getting bad news from doctors I once had the opportunity to to visit Anna Freud when I was a medical student in London and she asked me if I was going to become an analyst and I tried to be diplomatic and say well I'm not sure she said so you're not going to be an an she wasn't messing around you know why and I said said well I don't like the passivity I don't like not offering something trying to help fix things with people and she said you need to understand something when my father was training as a doctor it was considered a waste of time for a doctor to listen to a patient patients were there to listen to doctors and I was humbled by that I thought you know it was a very it was a very good point and she said it's hard to be analyzed because analysis is a Liberation from your parents and that's difficult if your parents are analysts and and she knew better than anyone cuz her father was her analyst actually oh boy lots to unpack there yeah there was a lot in the doct patient relationship in in that time that was pretty grim and so the fact that Mesmer was talking to patients and listening to them made him very popular so they got King Louie to convene a panel to investigate Mesmer and they the panel was very interesting our own Benjamin Franklin was on he was having a lot of fun why was Mesmer being investigated because he was competing so successfully with French doctors they didn't French doctor the French doctor Lobby the French doctor Lobby pulled out the stops they said that his his theory was all wrong that he wasn't really changing magnetic fields which is correct it's true they they concluded and another member of the panel was leazier the brilliant French chemist who developed oxygen chemistry and who 6 months before he was beheaded in the French reol ution discovered the idea of the gross national product he was a genius and one of the other panel members was a doctor named Dr guillot the inventor of the guillotine he kind of created the Mind Body problem what a panel yeah what a panel it's like the setup for a joke yeah it it is but it wasn't Unfortunately they concluded that hypnosis was nothing but heated imagination and you know what I I've heard worse definitions than hypnosis but that was it for Mesmer yeah and so you know it's set in motion a pattern of why hypnosis is just an underdeveloped resource is that people think it's either dangerous or it's ridiculous and it's neither it's a valuable effective treatment that we have underutilized for decades for centuries if you had to pick one or two anything that comes to mind some of the more more surprising patient outcomes or changes that you've seen because there are cases where I'm sure you could have predicted the outcomes I have 50% chance this person has a 30% reduction in ab and C symptoms but were there any that really stand out to you as surprising well the first one was the one that got me to decide that yes this happens to me my father's interest but I'm not going to let that deter me from something I'm interested in and it was the first patient I ever used hipnosis with it was on my Pediatrics rotation at Children's Hospital in Boston the nurse says Spiegel your patient is in room 3 42 she's in status asthmaticus she's been hospitalized every month for 3 months and she's back again and she hasn't responded epinephrine twice and we're going to maybe give her general anesthesia and put her on steroids so I walk in the room following the sound of the weees down the hall pretty 15-year-old girl bolt upright in bed struggling for breath Knuckles white mother standing there crying I didn't know what to do but I had taken hypnosis course so I saidwell would you like to learn a breathing exercise she nods so I get her hypnotized and then I break into a sweat and I think wait a minute we haven't gotten an Asma in the course so I said something very subtle and clever I said each Breath You Take will be a little deeper and a little easier and within 5 minutes she's lying back in bed she's not wheezing anymore her mother stopped crying nurse runs out of the room and if you think about the dynamic of that I mean it was stunning to me I couldn't believe it you know but each time she tried to breathe and had trouble she got more and more anxious because she thinks I'm going to not be able to breathe it's very frightening so you have her anxiety building like a snowball rolling downhill on top of the physical Sensations so in comes my intern and he said I thought he was going to Pat me on the back and say good for you you know he said the nurse has filed a complaint with the nursing supervisor that you violated Massachusetts law by hypnotizing a minor without parental consent could you're not and Massachusetts has a lot of dumb laws but that is not on the list and furthermore her mother was standing next to me when I did it he said well you're going to have to stop doing this and I said oh really why he said because it could be dangerous and I said you're going to give her general anesthesia and put her on steroids and my talking to her is dangerous I don't think so so I said tell you what as long as she's my patient I'm not telling her something I know isn't true so take me off the case if you want so he storms out of the room he finds the chief resident and the attending and they have a council of war and they came back with a radical solution they said let's ask the patient you know I don't think they'd ever thought of that before breakthrough yeah breakthrough and she said oh I like this I want to keep doing this and she was hospitalized one month after that a month later and went on to study to be a respiratory therapist and I thought that anything that could help a patient that much that fast frustrate the head nurse violated non-existing Massachusetts law had to be worth looking into and I've been doing it ever since but you know the nice thing is you can see it in front of your eyes you see whether it's going to help you know just like you with your pain you know it's the same thing if it's going to happen your brain is wired to every part of the body to make it happen quickly and it doesn't always happen but it often does I'd say the next major patient that really struck me when I first got to Stanford I was assigned to the paloalto VA Medical Center and there was an Army cook who had been mustered out of the army because after 19 years of good service something happened during the Ted offensive and he just grabbed an ambulance and some guns and ran out in the jungle and started shooting at what he thought were be at Kong and he seemed psychotic they couldn't contain him he was agitated he was emotionally uncontrolled he wasn't responding to meds and he wound up being discharged from the Army and spending 11 months in a state mental hospital in California California and a social worker there you know interviewed him and said this is not this doesn't look he's not a drug user he's you know he doesn't seem psychotic to me there's something wrong but I think it's post-traumatic so I saw him at the VA and he told me that something happened during the Deb offensive and it had something to do with a Vietnamese child that he had informally adopted he was like the youngest of 13 children he identified with young kids this kid had been badly burned was on a CR nobody seemed to claim him and so he just kind of took over and they became buddies and during the T offensive I find out in hypnosis he comes upon the boy's body and he realized he's been killed and in reliving this in hypnosis and he was very hypnotizable he says oh my God they hit g-wing oh my God they ain't got to kill kids they ain't got to kill kids so he's screaming and crying and then he's going into setting up defenses on a water power because he thinks they're going to be overrun by Viet Kong and he's going through all of that and I move him then and the remarkable thing was he was very intensely involved in all this but very malleable so I'd say okay we're going to change times now and we're going to go to the time when you collected his body and buried him and so he does that and he says ashes to ashes and dust to dust I guess that's it and then and then he starts banging on the arm of his chair and he says if I'd only taken you over to g-wing man you wouldn't be be there it's all my fault and I said tell me something would this boy blame you for what happened and he starts to smile he says no no he said you're number one cook you're my number one cook number one cook he knew he was going to die he was crippled he looked like he had arthritis and so I said okay we're going to go to a different time we're going to go to a time after the fun before the funeral when you had a party for him a happy memory because you know often with grief the reason it hurts so much is that you loved and cared about each other so much so there's something positive behind the grief right and so he says oh you look so happy the dut dollies brought a cake and my sister sent an electric train for a present for you you you never seen electric train before have you you know Vietnam Ain got no railroads and and and turned out later that the train was actually from Spiegel Brothers department store in Chicago and he said he's he's so happy you're my number one cook so I said okay we're going to put as much of this as you don't want to think about now behind a filter to be there if you need it but you're going to remember two things about this you're going to remember burying him and you're going to remember that birthday party and so he's you know he's sweating he's tears going down his cheeks and I brought him out of the hypnosis and he looked a little sort of Dazed he looked a little confused and I said what do you remember and he said doc I remember a grave and a cake that was a graveen a cake so it was a way of helping him acknowledge his grief begin to go through a process of grieving and but see it from two points of view that he had this time with this kid he made the boy happy the boy made him happy and that can't be taken away even though he died and he was in the hospital for a while longer he had he practiced it every day sitting in the ward he was doing his self hypnosis and he he was discharged he was upset he couldn't get back in the Army he wanted to but he'd been discharged his brother who was a police officer in Chicago was killed in the line of duty and he decompensated again but we processed decompensated mean you got symptoms all over again he started to you know look like he was hearing voices although he wasn't but you know discont control of emotion MH and so I had him grieve his brother's death in the same way and he got discharged he was spending his time training teenagers how to do longdistance cycling and he was out of the hospital and doing fine so you know I thought that anything that can help people in these rather extreme situations come to a new point of view and a hurry about that was you know worth pursuing and I've been doing it ever since and we've had people in in r a guy who was in his home for three years he was he had the social phobia you know where he just couldn't stand to leave his house he was there for three years and we taught him to use self hypnosis to deal with his anxiety and he's out in the world again he's living a normal life so it is surprising how much it can help people in a hurry what a remarkable story I want to ask you to just describe Ry for folks in a minute but first I want to ask in that circumstance where you have this veteran who some think psychotic who is getting really animated heated sweating to maintain your composure and direct that environment that in that state what does it take to get to that point where you're comfortable doing that it's a very hute question because it the intensity of it is remarkable we actually have a grainy old video of it but uh I sometimes get surprised myself I was actually holding on to his arm the whole time I didn't even realize it at the time but I was like trying to connect with him MH so that whatever else was going on he knew I was there with him and I guess part there were two things and one was it's a characteristic of Highly hypnotizable people that they can be having intense experiences and yet be connected and contained that is they're absorbed in it but they're not just out of control they're not just wild you know and because they're modulating they're expressing their emotion but they're also able to modulate and control it and focus on this sort of narrow container of being in tense in reliving what happened but also somehow aware that it is a reliving of the event it isn't actually happening and and so I figured you know it's like you got to have the reins of the horse when you're riding fast but it was clear to me that he was listening to me and what struck me the most and what reassured me frankly was that he could change times very easily he could change mood so literally transition from you know screaming I should have taken over the hooch man it's all my fault to ashes to ashes and dust to dust was a few seconds you know but he was following me and you know if I saw that he wasn't I'd spend more time on the control issue but it's also because the intensity had to do with something we were meaningfully working on that is I wasn't doing it just to have him show off how emotional he could be I was doing it to help him queue up into perspective the thing that was upsetting him so much and help him to process access it in a way that made him feel better about it it was so I knew I was doing something that I thought could help him and I'll tell you that in some of these intense kinds of hypnotic therapies you know I'm a little dissociated too you know just saying it's a smart hypnotist that knows who is hypnotizing whom but I'm kind of listening to my own mind saying what's the next step what do we need to do here and I'm thinking about it for a second and saying is this really the right thing well let's try it out and see and so I'm also testing his respon and if I see that we're not getting anywhere then I'll change course so and it and it takes some time in training to just sort of know the direction you want to go in and why you're doing this and is it really going to help him or is it just putting on a show and it was clear to me that what he needed to do and and you get this sort of deep connection with somebody that they can feel you and you can feel them you know he knows what I'm trying to do and I know what he's needs to do I think there might be something to the correspondence of trait hypnotizability and good candidacy for psychedelic assisted therapies I really do because that what you just described also I think would be mirrored in many patient reports who exhibit strong durable outcomes they're able to switch from one thing to the next very quickly from one maybe very positive emotional veilance to one very negative emotional violence and then back and forth while still maintaining some Seance of Observer awareness if that makes sense so very very very very curious who is Ry designed for R is designed for anybody who's curious about dealing with their problems if you just want to learn something about your ability to explore and change your mental States it's useful it's a tool you know it it's more like an antibiotic than a vitamin if you've got a problem you can try it and see if it will help so people with pain stress insomnia that's uh our most popular use people getting to sleep or getting back to sleep I I used to worry that Ry wasn't quite as good as being in my office with me and then I thought if you wake up at 3:00 in the morning and need to get back to sleep you probably don't want me in your bedroom helping you do it you probably don't want to be in I don't either someone bedroom at 3 in the morning that's exactly right um it's very useful for dealing with phobias like airplane phobias claustrophobia I had a lovely woman who had had obsessive compulsive disorder or life and claustrophobia was diagnosed recently with cancer and had to have a scan in an enclosed tube and just was freaked out about doing it and I had her picture being doing two things that made her feel better one is just floating somewhere she felt comfortable and she said I remember floating in the Dead Sea and I thought for a cancer patient that might not be the ideal image but the you know the intense solinity of the she makes you float like a cork and so she liked it so I said okay we'll do that and she had a very loving sister in New York who would come out to visit her and I said and I want you to imagine that your sister is standing next to that scanner giving you a hug and reassuring you and she came out of it and she started to cry and she said for the first time I think I can do this you know I can actually do this I mean she was afraid to go in an elevator by herself was too scary she'd wait in the hospital I know multiple people who have this issue with elevators airplanes right and with airplanes I have people imagine they're floating with the plane you know just you're the way you take a roller coaster ride don't fight the plane float with it and see the plane is an extension of your body like a bicycle you want to get somewhere faster you're using the plane as an extension of your body the pilot is an extension of your mind you chose an airline that has good pilots and he's or she is an extension of your mind so Concepts like that can help people do self- hypnosis and get froml point A to point B so that's good and then for habit problems like smoking or drinking or eating badly you know you can learn to eat like a gourmet you can enjoy eating more while you eat healthier food by using the self hypnosis to do that what have you used if anything self hypnosis for on yourself I had recurrent location of my shoulder and I realized I needed surgery done and it was it's a 3-hour operation it's it's a big deal had my left shoulder reconstructed it's a lot of fun isn't it yeah so fun I use general anesthesia for the surgery itself but afterwards I just did self hypnosis for the pain control you know and it was a Mass General and I wasn't supposed to read my record but I worked there so you know the nurse kind of looks at me like and the resident wrote in my record patient using very little pain medication we mustn't have cut many nerves now you know I've got a scar from here to here I can tell you they cut nerves but you know it's it's this misunderstanding that you know the body is just like a a broken car you just got to you know incision ingestion or injection you know you got to do something to the body rather than teach the person to use the control system that we're all born with this three pound object at top of our shoulders that is connected to every part of the body and helps to control and why on Earth shouldn't we be able to use that better you know it doesn't come with a users's manual you know so you got to figure out how to do it but it makes a huge difference and and so you know hypnosis is not a commodity it's a skill to be shared and that's one reason actually it's underutilized is you know I don't have a bunch of ex- cheerleaders going to doctor's offices telling them use hypnosis but drug companies do and you know I'm a doctor I prescribe meds but there are many times when doing something like this is much better and safer and more effective could also be the given the very favorable risk profile something that you at least attempt before moving on to more severe interventions that's exactly right you know why not try this first I had a I had a young woman 7 months pregnant very bad lower back disease and of course as the baby grew you know it got worse they put in a nerve stimulator it didn't help and they couldn't give her opioids because she was you know had it Pregnant and So I have her imagined she's floating in a nice warm bath filtered the hurt out of the pain her pain went from 7 to 3 in a couple of minutes but she looked angry and I said what's the matter she said why in the hell are you the last doctor I got sent to instead of the first and that's exactly right Tim I don't get it you know it's inexpensive it's effective why not try that first and then if that doesn't work do something else it it's really a shame it's it's a diservice to people who can help themselves it's it's excessively expensive to do use medications or procedures when some people may not need it some do but a lot don't and so I would like to see R used as a kind of placeholder while people are getting evaluated and and getting appointments with people who can help them deal with with whatever their pain or other problem is it can take forever to find a good specialist meaning outside of hypnosis I mean I I have a friend who's dealing with a very unpredictable onset of what he describes as overwhelm that seemed to begin after he had a a pretty bad neck injury he was constantly in this flexed position while he was working at his laptop and then he went to play tennis one day went into a serve bent his head back and had some type of um structure event that then precipitated this this onset of what he would call sort of overwhelm where he goes into fighter flight and really can't focus her work and it's taken many many many many months to find Specialists to work with just to begin the trial and error so in the meantime I could see something like this being incredibly valuable aside from R and people can find Ry at ry.com Great Name by the way re v r i that's correct. right and on all the socials we'll link to that in the show notes as well but ry.com and I would imagine that can be found in the App Store as well but r v e r i re v r i in addition to that are there any resources because I'm sure there's The Good the Bad and the Ugly when it comes to hypnosis resources whether those are books documentaries or otherwise are there any particular resources for those who would like to try to educate themselves more explore this more there are a number of good professional hypnosis societies that have members who are professionally trained in use hypnosis the society for clinical and experimental hypnosis s. us the American Society of clinical hypnosis as. NE there's an international Society of hypnosis for your listeners who are elsewhere there are good textbooks on hypnosis we've written one of them called trans and treatment my light father and I that's available there are other good apps there's one leaf which is a French app that the French government has invested in that has excellent recordings to help people use hypnosis there's one called nerva out of Australia that helps people with irritable bowel syndrome and hypnosis can be very effective for that as well so there are more and more of those apps coming as well that that seem to help people manage with hypnosis so it it's growing the list is growing so we'll link to all those and trans and treatment I must ask since you mentioned Bali and I've seen various types of yeah I think what we would consider trance whether that's mhm Sufi spinning or MH various types of repetitive singing droning mhm do you have any particular longstanding type of Trance that you find most interesting or appealing there's a a sociologist book called boiling energy about the use of drumming actually like kind of trans inducing experience in Africa and there's no question that people use that kind of rhythmic activity as as a way of socially connecting and soothing themselves you know and there's something about being in that rhythm of rate that you know is usually roughly the rate of heartbeat you know about One a second that that helps people and it's why people like to dance and sing and things like that I think we coordinated social activity that gets the body involved can be very soothing actually and so I think a lot of our you know healing rituals involve repetitive movement that people find soothing David thank you for what a what a fantastic wide- ranging conversation this became and is there anything else you'd like to mention of course people can find Ry ry.com r a v ri.com is there anything else you'd like to mention or Point people to it's from the App Store and Google play as well has it if you if people have Android phones I would say I think we've talked about the major the major uses of it I would love it if people can give it a try see it as a a first recourse not a last recourse and I'd love to see it integrated better with people's overall health and wellness care I think it's been sort of the Rodney danger field of psychotherapies can't get no respect yeah he said they asked me to leave a bar so they could start happy hour you [Laughter] know after having done this my entire career this is a legacy project for me I you know a time will come when I'm not available to keep doing this for people it warms my heart that while we've been talking I've helped more people than I used to in months of you know personto person clinical activity and I want people to to have it as a resource for helping themselves to feel better and function better and I think it can so thank you for helping me do that because that's the same kind of thing you're doing with your show and I'm honored to be a part of it my pleasure entirely what fun this is best job on Earth as far as I'm concerned and to everybody listening we will have links to all things discussed in the show notes as per usual at tim.

        "  'transcript': \"[Music] this episode is brought to you by element spelled l m NT what on Earth is element it is a delicious sugar-free electrolyte drink mix I've stocked up on boxes and boxes of this it was one of the first things that I bought when I saw Co coming down the pike and I usually use one to two per day element is formulated to help anyone with their electrolyte needs and perfectly suited to folks following a keto low carb or paleo diet or if you drink a ton of water and you might not have the right balance that's often when I drink it or if you're doing any type of endurance exercise mountain biking Etc another application if you've ever struggled to feel good on keto low carbo paleo it's most likely because even if you're consciously consuming electrolytes you're just not getting enough and it relates to bunch of stuff like a hormone called aldosterone blah blah blah when insulin is low but suffice to say this is where element again spelled l MNT can help my favorite flavor by far is Citrus salt which as a side note you can also use to make a kickass no sugar Margarita but for special occasions obviously you're probably already familiar with one of the names behind it Rob wolf r o BB Rob wolf who is a former research biochemist and two-time New York Times best-selling author of The Paleo Solution and wired to eat Rob created element by scratching his own itch that's how it got started his Brazilian jiu-jitsu coaches turned him on to electrolytes as a performance enhancer things clicked and Bam company was born so if you're on a low carb diet or fasting electrolytes play a key role in relieving hunger cramps headaches tiredness and dizziness sugar artificial ingredients coloring all that's garbage unneeded there's none of that in element and a lot of names you might recognize are already using El it was recommended to be by one of my favorite athlete friends three Navy SEAL Teams as prescribed by their Master Chief Marine units FBI sniper teams at least five NFL teams who have subscriptions they are the exclusive hydration partner to Team USA weightlifting and on and on you can try it risk-free if you don't like it

ladies and germs this is Tim Ferris welcome to another episode of the Tim ferah show where it is my job every episode to interview world class performers from different disciplines to tease out the habits routines Lessons Learned Etc that you can apply to your own lives my guest today is someone I've wanted to have on the podcast for years we did the interview at his house in Idaho he has no social media no website and his name is Scott Glenn he is a legend Scott Glenn's acting career spans nearly 60 years his impressive film resume includes performances in Apocalypse Now Urban Cowboy the right stuff Silverado The Hunt for Red October the Silence of the Lambs Backdraft The Virgin Suicides and the born ultimatum I would venture that every single one of you would recognize his face more recently Scott has appeared on the small screen as Kevin Garvey senior in The Leftovers the blind Sensei stick in Marvel's Daredevil and the Defenders and as the retired Sheriff Allan Pangborn in Castle Rock this year Scott will return to HBO to join season 3 of The White Lotus and there is so much more to his story he has I would consider consider it the gold medal trifecta in terms of Mastery across life and we'll get into exactly what that means but I've wanted to have this conversation with Scott for a very very long time it took place on his couch in his living room and I'll leave it at that please enjoy a very wide- ranging conversation with the one and only legendary Scott Glenn I have an embarrassment of riches here we could start just about anywhere but I thought I would start with saying that I'm in part so happy to be having this conversation because even among all of the hundreds of people I've interviewed if we look at people in their 30s and 40s they don't check career Fitness and relationships but you seem to have 50 plus years checking all three of those boxes it's hard to find three out of three in the Young Guns who have sort of wide open field ahead of them and I want to dig into that but I thought I would start with Idaho because we're sitting here in your home it's been a long time since I've been here and you have elk in the backyard this is not what most people imagine when they think Hollywood star how did you end up in Idaho a bunch of years ago so we've been up here for I'm not sure the exact number but in the mid to high 40 years we were living in LA my wife is probably throws on the wheel as well as any two dozen people on the planet she's really a good Potter she was accepted to a summer workshop was invitation only to the best ceramic artist in this country and it was going to last all summer long and we were living in La we had a place in Tanga so she said we had a VW van typical hippie dippy live out of the back of it she was going up with our two daughters to do this workshop and she said well you're going to come with me and I went no I you know I I'm I'm waiting for the phone to ring to tell me whether I've got a job or not and she said does the phone really have to ring for you to kick you in your ass to go anywhere can't you just do something on your own and I went I don't know she said well you can because there's a group of people who are leaving from but place she wasn't sure where as it turns out was chalice Idaho that they're leaving on the following dates which was like a week after her Workshop started she said they're going into an area called the Big Horn Crags that the biggest primitive area in the contiguous United States bigger than anywhere except Alaska and they're going to be doing high mountains this is in July they're going to be doing high mountain traverses in snow and ice for 3 days then they're going to be going down into into a little Valley and climbing rock faces and and naming them for the geodesic survey it's being led by a guy named Eric Ryback who's the first at that time the only person ever to walk the whole Pacific Coast the trail from Canada down to the bottom of waja and she said you're going with him you know I was a rock climber at the time so she knew that about me but I said how do you know she said cuz I signed you up so it was like I had no choice in the matter so we got up here I tend to overdo things physically it's just part of my stupid personality so we got here and I started hiking up Baldi now we come from sea level to hear so I got altitude sickness the first day and puked my guts out about four or five times and at any rate I had about a week to try to get ready and then she drove me North to chalice us I think there were seven people on this trip with us so I met Eric Ryback and these people I was going to be hanging out with for the next few weeks and we drove 90 mil on a dirt road to the Cobalt Ranger Station where you didn't tell them where you were going you just told them when you expected to be back and if you weren't back inside I think the cushion was 3 days they were going to send people out to look for you and at the time it's probably still true the Big Horn cracks no internal combustion allowed at all so if uh forestry service had to go in and open up Trail heads they had to go in with mules Twan Crosscut saws because you couldn't turn on a that wouldn't work so we did that and it was I hadn't been off on my own alone with the exception of ones that I won't talk about but been in that situation and it was just so much fun and so cleansing and so it was just the best and I thought I knew how to rock climb but there was a guy named Tony Jones there who was a great rock climber who sort of took me under his wing and took me into 511 Plus+ stuff the dangerous stuff he let all of it so I don't want to pretend that I just instantly did it but I did do those climbs again and again and I remember when Carol was going to come and pick when we were done it was like 2 weeks and a little over 2 and 1 half weeks of doing this I said to Tony I got to give you some money or something I mean you've been giving me he said come on I had a great time I said what can I do for you and he said you can do this when you go back to LA tell everybody how horrible Idaho is tell them it's a tick fever State it's it sucks and you had a bad time and I said why should I do that he said because I don't want people coming up here so when Carol drove me back into catch him I felt like I was entering Lower Manhattan it was like noise and people and and it's a small town for people who don't have the cont town but what I discovered this sounds wooah and whatever but yeah I don't really give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] cuz it's true it was like the family fell in love with each other again I had been sort of living in the Blues in LA because of what I do for a living and all that fell away up here here when you came to Idaho roughly how old were you and where was your career at that point I was probably 38 39 like that late 30s and had you already had a sort of inflection point in your career at that point I had done a ton of work in New York mainly Street Theater improv off off Broadway and then we moved to LA for me to do the first film I ever did which was called Baby Maker and then I did a couple of sort of very small parts in big important American movies one was Nashville Bob alman's film and the other was Apocalypse Now that I was on for a little over seven months they shot that film it was the shooting was a year and a half so I was a short time or at 7 months but that was my experience of working in front of a camera learning a lot of stuff that stood me in really good stad later on but what had happened in La was okay I had gone to Universal I think to audition I'd done some TV stuff at Universal and I gone there and because of my experience with apocalypse what had happened before is I would go in and I would audition for a TV job mainly at one of the studios and people would tell me what a crap crappy actor I was you squint too much you're not loud enough you're not doing this you're not doing that and on the surface I would say well what do you know but the reality was underneath it I suspected maybe they were right and I didn't know what I was doing in terms of a camera on stage or doing improv in the back of an alley yeah I could do that so I had no self-confidence and then I did Apocalypse Now and wound up working my choice Francis thought I think incorrectly but he thought that he owed me because he thought I saved his life in the Philippines so I went over to do a small part and he said I'll write you whatever you want because you filled up a helicopter in a rainstorm with nothing getting in the gas and you kept me from drowning in a river so come back okay fine that's nice he said what do you want and I said I want to be in the end of the movie and he said you can't be in the end of the movie Scott it's absolutely completely cast well yeah wait there is a part you could do but You' be like a glorified extra play Colby the guy who came up River in front of Morton Sheen and I understood because of the way I I've learned everything in my life that's important to me is you learn by apprenticeship not from a book or going to school at least I can't and I thought at the end of the movie I'm going to going to be around the person who in my mind is Far and Away the greatest American probably the greatest movie actor that ever lived Marlon Brando and I'm going to be around this guy and just being around him and Dennis Hopper who's a lunatic but brilliant and Martin Sheen and the end of this movie is an experience that will change my life and it did I told Francis later on that I got the greatest gift you could give any artist in in the Philippines which was self-confidence so I when I came back before we went up to Idaho I was basically locked out of universal because along with self-confidence I came back with a huge amount of arrogance and now I remember I did one audition and they said you know you're not really very good we want to give you things to work on and I said what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] do you know who have you worked with because I was just doing improvs and work with morl and Brando VI Torio staro Francis copela Dennis Hopper and they accepted me as an equal what have you done you've done this and this you can't even [\\xa0__\\xa0] direct traffic so they kick me out of universal so now we're back from Idaho yeah and I'm sitting watching television smoking a joint and Carol walks into the living room and says babe what's wrong and I say what do you mean I'm fine she said no you're crying and I reached up and there were tears coming out of my eyes I was on television and a Beretta I had done and I pointed at and I said you're supposed to get better at what you do not worse that's the crappiest acting I've ever seen I was so much better doing Street Theater in New York what's happened to me and I started thinking and that night at dinner I said you know what I've turned into in LA and I'm horrible at it is a show business politician which is what am I up for who do I know what openings and parties can I go to to network and make and I used to think what makes this person tick why are they doing what they do what belief system are they coming from all that stuff that I really cared about then and du to this day and I said to Carol I said how would you and the girls feel if we mov back to Idaho and she said what do you do up there and I said I met somebody who told me that if I gave him three years he would Apprentice me to be an Back Country cross country ski guide and hunting guide and I'll do that and she said will you quit acting I said no I'll do Shakespeare in the park and Boise if I can get aart I'll do that kind of stuff but I can't go back to New York with my two daughters this young and subject them to the life of a street actor so we came up here with with that in mind it was a super cold year we came up with a friend of Carol's in mine he was a commercial director but sort of feeling the same kind of burnout in La that I felt so the two families decided we'd come up here and try to figure out what to do and catch a Idaho no real idea we were up here inside two weeks I get a call from a friend of mine guy named rert hitzig who said I'm doing a movie in uh in Mexico the way I knew rert was he and I were in the same platoon in the Marine Corps so rup said I'm producing a movie in Mexico and I can give you a small part in it you will be shooting for three months and I got like I think it was I can give you 2,000 bucks and I said great so Carol and I went to Mexico and I was warned when I went down there it starred rodiger Bert Lancaster Amanda plumber and Diane Lane those were the stars and I had a teeny tiny little part is one of Bert's it was the duelan Dalton Gang Western and I was told by a lot of people I went down there you're going to love Rod stiger he works the same way you do he's a member of the actor studio and you're kind of guy but watch out for Bert Lancaster he's an old school movie star he'll get in your key light he'll screw you up he'll intentionally ruin two shots so they'll have to go to his closeup just just watch out for him so we go to Mexico first day there El Presidente wabby hotel in in Mexico I meet rod stiger and I I rarely openly dislike somebody when I meet them but I wouldn't say it was hate at First Sight but it was certainly dislike at First Sight and then a little bit later bur Lancaster comes into the lobby and to be really honest he hardly saw me all but he's boy did he see Carol and he said to her so what do you do and she said I'm a Potter he said you got any pictures and she says she has some little slide pictures of stuff she'd done he looked at them and I could see something Chang in him and he looked at her and he said God this I love this stuff I only have the work of one other ceramic artist would you throw me 11 place or 12 Place din wear set was her first commission ever she said yeah yeah I will later on many months later she found out the other ceramic artist that he owned was named Picasso wow so the next day and he kind of was like I wasn't even there so the next day we're on the set getting ready to do some scene it's a group shot at the end of the first take Burke walks over to me and he said so Scott has anybody ever taught you the difference between working with a closeup C camera lens and being on stage he said I know you've done Street Theater I can tell right I said no he said I didn't think so he said you know I'm not going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] you I seriously was watching you and I think you've got something but if you'll permit me to be a gigantic pain in the ass over the next three months I'll teach you whatever I know wow what an incredible opportunity so he taught me about how to work with a camera and how to I mean he was an amazing guy he was an aerialist who traveled across the country with a carnival and to make drinking money fought people in tough man content he was the real deal I love B it was like what people had told me about Roden BT was like he could flip it around totally flipped so on the way home this is a long we got we got all the time in the world so we're coming back from Mexico they went to Paramount to see a friend of Carol's and M that on their advice Carol got pregnant they said you guys have got to have a baby and we were really close Jim was the director Jim Bridges and Jack Larson was his partner lover whatever and they were great guys super great guys so we wanted to just say hi to him on our way back to Idaho we walk into his office he looks at me he said I can't believe you're coming in here he said you I just realized you're perfect for this part in this movie I'm directing it's the bad guy but you're perfect for it just hang around town for two or three more days meet the star who has cast approv didn't tell me who it was who has cast approval and the producers here at Paramount and I think we can make this happen and I said screw that I don't go into anybody's office like a piece of meat anymore I just made 2,000 bucks and we're on our way back to Idaho I just wanted to tell you I love you and I hope you and Jack are well and Carol and I are out of here so we left we came back up to Idaho about two weeks later maybe a little less I get a call from Jim and he said okay now I'm on location in Houston Paramount doesn't know who you are they don't want you to they want Ryan O'Neal to do this part or maybe Sam Shepard but I'm going to send you a plane ticket to come down here I think we can make this work I've told Irving AO the music guy who's also producer about you and he likes the idea you got to meet him I think we can make this happen and I said no don't send me a plane ticket I don't want them to have their hooks into me even for a plane ticket just to feel my GMC Jimmy I'll drive to Houston and I'll see you down there and I said just tell me what the part is and he said a bank robber and a bull rider and I went okay so I drive down to Houston on my way to Houston I stop off just in front of Huntsville prison where I knew that the character I played spent some time and I'm going to be a little shady about this because I kind of have to be but so I'm sitting there in my Jimmy and I hear familiar voices out of the dark saying Hey Vato what are you doing and I look over and there when he was alive in another part of my life I knew Freddy Fender the country western singer all right whose real name was baly Mara and Freddy was in a family that picked everything illegally that was his background and he hung out with these two guys who were for real just AOS the real deal and these two guys were there and they said what are you doing here man I told them what I was doing they went we don't believe this we got our buddy coming out he'll be out of here in a 15 20 minutes you got to meet him he's a bank robber and a bull rider and I went yeah Mexican guy said no man he's a [\\xa0__\\xa0] Gringo and I went okay so I met this guy who told me enough about the character that I was going to be playing and little things like he said you got to get a hat sticker or something not a tat to but something on you that says 132 cuz that's the number that gets us in here and we all have it and I said what's that stand for and he said judge jury and a half-ass lawyer so I said okay and he said and you got to get tattoos on your forearm Nester Familia I said but I'm not a Latino he said neither am I and showed me that he had that what did that refer to our family like what was the that's the impr prison organization of Latin I see I see that he to mhm so he gave me that to do and then I said is there anything about being a bull rider that bull riders do that I could learn that most people can't do and he showed me he said yeah when you tie off your glove since you're going to be using your dominant hand to wrap the rawh hiide around you're going to have to use your non-dominant hand and your teeth and he said you're going to have to do it a lot of times to the point where you can go without even thinking about it so I went okay okay I'm going to do that at least 100 times a day from now on hopefully a thousand I get down to Houston Jim said I'm going to make this happen I met the actress who was had never played the lead in a big movie Deborah Winger and both she John travola Irving a off and Jim Bridges always all kind of like shove me down um Paramount's throat and Jim said this movie is going to change your life you'll never have to audition again after you do it and he told me the truth I didn't believe it but in those it was Urban Cowboy yeah and the part was West high tower it was funny cuz when I read the script I thought all I have to do is be honest with this character I'm not going to go for big moments right because if I'm honest with I'll jump off the screen at people simply because this movie is about Oil Workers and bluecollar workers who dress up like Outlaw Cowboys on weekends to go in and ride not a real bull but a bull machine yeah mechanical and I'm going to play a guy who's a real bank robber a real xcon and a real bull rider and if I just get close to just close to it I'll look like a diamond in a bucket full of rhinestones not because I'm particularly good but it was almost like a setup so anyway that happened and I didn't have to audition I audition once since then for a part that not a big part in the movie I really wanted to do and the director said no no at that point I don't want you to do it so I went to a cattle call under an assume name audition for it and got that part but since I did Urban Cowboy my life has changed and I thought I was offered the lead in some TV series while I was in Texas because in those days dailies were shared Cared by everybody in the in the business so I turned them all down because I thought I don't want to leave Idaho and move back to LA I love my life in Idaho I love I didn't know how to ski but I was learning how to ski and I was climbing and I was hiking and I was shooting and I was riding motorcycles and all the things I really love to do and plus I could really cleanly think about and concern myself with the art of acting and not who do I know and where am I going and I've got this cool place in Malibu or any of that stuff the politics and the show so uh so I turned down the TV stuff when I'd been in Texas Carol had she hadn't left me but I knew at a certain point when I was playing West high tower that I had the character but I was terrified if I left it alone and put it down it'd be like a bar of soap and I tried to pick it up and I wouldn't so I Liv that part 247 7 got arrested got in trouble I was West high tower the whole time I remember at one point I came back to we had an apartment in the gallery and I came back and none of Carol's clothes were there was no presence of them in the apartment and there had been I had gone to work that day and I'm thinking what's going on the phone is ringing I pick it up and it's Carol and she said I'm back in Idaho I can't handle living with West high tower so you let me know when he's dead said me and the girls love you we're up here but we're not going to put ourselves through this and I went okay and I was about to hang up and she said wait before you hang up I just wanted to say one thing I said what's that she said two things number one I love you and number two I think you're hitting a home run with this and it's going to change our lives so when I drove back up here my Jimmy I remember I stopped off in Wyoming at one point people a thigh was nuts and I got out of the Jimmy and I walked down to the side of the road and I took this invisible West high tower and threw him in the ground broke his [\\xa0__\\xa0] neck and called Carol at a pay phone I said West high tower is dead I'm coming home wow okay let okay okay continue and then we're goingon to go back to the origin story got home we were runting this house with this family that had come up with us we were sharing this house we had a bedroom room on the bed were two scripts for the leads and movies for more money than I'd ever dreamed about making and that was that so here I am in Idaho what uh we're going to go back in time we're going to slowly rewind because I have a couple of follow-up questions one is Jim Bridges what did he see what gave him the feeling or the confidence to say this is going to change your life what do you think it was was it that setup that you talked about I had done my first movie with him and I got the movie I came out here and I met him but I didn't audition for the part there was a director Ed Ed Peron who i' done a thing called in New York it was called collision course it was 91 act in the course of the night and Ed said to Jim if you're looking for somebody a young guy who's not going to charge you a ton of money and it's perfect for the part Scott Glenn's the guy so I got that part and did the movie so Jim knew me over a period of in those days movies took about three months to shoot now it's way faster and I guess whatever it was he saw in me it was jangled awake when we walked into his office coming back from Mexico that was when he went oh my God I something that he saw about me he wrote the script for Urban Cowboy with Aaron lean the guy who had originally written a column in I don't know if was the time some place in New York about Gillies and bull machines and all that stuff and then Jim adapted that and wrote the screenplay I don't know what it was he saw I remember my screen test they wanted me to do a scene from the and I said I can't do that I'm not in the part I don't want to lose it and Jim said well we've got to put you on on screen and I said and Deborah was doing her sexy bull ride at the time and there were a bunch of guys in the front watching and I picked out the baddest looking one of all who was a Bandido Texas and I said put the camera on me and I thought dear Lord don't let this go bad but here we go and they were watching Deborah and I walked over to him and I went hey and he looked up at me and I said you're sitting on my [\\xa0__\\xa0] seat and he looked at me and I thought what's going to happen and he got up and walked away and I went and sat down that was my screen test just a quick thanks to one of our sponsors and we'll be right back to the show this episode is brought to you by ag1 the daily foundational nutritional

time and this is just based on what I researched online but it seems like initially you you were not born out of the womb dreaming of being an actor it seems like you wanted to be a writer yeah and how did acting enter the scene for you and I I read a bit about berhoff I wanted to be a writer and if I look back on my whole life the most important single event in my life was scarlet fever when I was 9 years old I wasn't supposed to have survived there was one weekend when the doctors told my mom and dad to get a plot and what saved my life was crystalline penicillin I don't know if you've ever had that a shot of it but it's interesting cuz usually with most shots it's the needle going in that hurts and it's fine crystalline penicillin is like thicker than engine grease yeah so the me needle going in kind of hurts but then the rest of it going in straightens you up and I didn't realize it was saving my life so I hated it but that experience turned me into an athlete turned me into someone who had learn to not only live with but fall in love with my fantasies and my imagination and I don't know if it's true or not and I don't want to know because it's a fantasy that I if it's not true I grew up believing it was that on my mom's side of the family I was directly related to Lord Byron when I got out of bed from scarlet fever my bones were so soft that they bent I limp like for almost 4 years but it turned me into an athlete cuz I was just embarrassed about the way I looked and I was in a neighborhood where it wasn't good to be physically frail and this was uh Pittsburgh yeah M at any rate I decided you know two things number one I wasn't going to be Walder midy I wasn't going to have an imaginary life the adventures I was imagining were all going to be true I was going to make them come true and one of them was I was going to be a writer poet writer so when I enlisted in the Marine Corps I enlisted as a six-month reservice why did you do that because you went from English major to Marine Corps cuz where I came from there was nobody dodged the draft and the draft was happening I see so for me and I knew even with a ba in college I had so little technical ability everybody will tell you about that if I was smart enough I would have tried to become probably a Naval aviator but I wasn't smart enough to be a pilot so where I came from the choices worth three Marine Corps a82 Airborne 101st Airborne that's it and then a friend of mine said well you can be airborne and a marine both and then I was worried about my hearing because I've been legally deaf since I was 10 years old because of scar and they laughed they said you're going to be an enlisted Marine you're going to boot camp at Paris Island you're worried about your hearing people are going to scream at you the whole time you're there and then you're going to be shooting automatic weapons without your hearing protection it your hearing is going to be trash don't worry about it so that was my reason so I did my six months in the Marine Corps and this was the 60s where if you were a reservist you didn't really have to make weekend meetings in summer camp there were other ways of doing your time of deployments for 3 months or a month month and a half whatever when I got out of the Marine Corps I went to see my mom and dad who were living in kosha Wisconsin my dad was at that point he gotten pretty high up and Snap-on Tools when when I was born he was a Salesman so he went from no money and no nothing to he actually wound up kind of running that company I went to Kenosha there was a job opening on the Kenosha Daily News and I did an interview and lied as I often do um they said can you type and I went yeah and they said how many words a minute and I said 35 cuz I knew that's what I needed after the interview they said well you got the job I came out and there was a Joe jacobe one of the reporters there said you should be happy you don't look happy and I said oh I'll tell you the truth I lied I don't know how to type it all and he said me and one other reporter will cover for you Scott for two weeks you go to adult education at the public high school and learn how to type and what was the job for this was the were you transcribing or what was the job the job was cover reporter I got it I was not very good at what I so anyway I'm up in the city room doing that and I hear shots out the window and it was cold as [\\xa0__\\xa0] and remember I said to somebody in the city room those are shots go out and check them out and it was like 30 below zero it was freezing cold and somebody said no that was a car backfire and I said vapor lock cars aren't even starting now and there's a most stuff in life I don't know but I just got out of the Marine Corps and gunfire I do know and I'm telling you those were shots and they said why don't you go out and cover it so I went outside and two blocks from the newspaper at the side of the road was a city patrol car with Mrs hwad doll the chief of police's wife sitting in the driver's seat with her husband's pistol smoking in her lap and next to her Dorothy Battis who was the chief of police's secretary SL mistress with half her head blown away it was my story it was the biggest story obviously so they made me a police reporter and I real I thought being a police reporter would be really cool cuz I'll cover you know mob hits and all that stuff and I realized that you do do that but you're all for every one of those you do six interviewing a woman 15 minutes after her teenage son has died in a traffic accident and you're thinking about do I get a byy line is this going to be on page one or page two and I felt like a there was a bulletin board with other jobs listed so I applied for the job of a reporter on the sports desk I can't even remember the name of the paper but it was in American Virgin Islands I got the job and I was talking to a friend of mine on the phone and she lives in Long Island and she said when's the job start and I said in about 6 months and she said why don't you go to New York and take an acting class and I went why and she said I'll be honest with you Scott I read the stuff that you're right and your description of ideas and action and places isn't bad it's okay but your dialogue essentially sucks it's stiff nobody talks like that the minute you put words in anybody's mouth whether it's a poem or a short story whatever you blow it if you have to get in front of people and say words it'll kick you in your ass to start to listen to the way people really talk and if you're doing theater you'll be dealing with arguably the best dialogue ever read written so after I got over maybe 5 or 10 minutes of being angry cuz she told me the truth I thought okay so I got my car I had an old Triumph and I drove to New York sold the car got two jobs I looked up acting in the Village Voice nothing under a under B it's said buroff Studios I didn't know anything about it I call it up call it beroff Studios and this guy named Bill hickey who was one of America's greatest character actors nominated before he might have gotten an Academy Award for God I can't think of it anyway Bill answers the phone and he says yeah work on this bring it by beroff Studios Wednesday morning it was oh Dad Poor Dad Mom was hugging in the closet I'm feeling so sad was the play something I'm completely unsuited for but was a little monologue I worked on it I go down into the basement of buroff it was raining outside Wednesday morning maybe seven or eight people sitting there to watch I walk in front of Bill hickey to start this monologue and for the first and only time I life literally a light bulb went off between my eyes and I thought holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] I'm an actor that fast and it wasn't like oh I'm so fulfilled it was for the first time my life made sense to me my proclivity to daydream my laziness in a lot of areas everything made sense like that and Bill saw it and he started laughing and he said that's right you're one of us and then he turned to the the other students and he said Scott's not going to finish this he's got to go outside walk around the block a couple times and think about things I went outside there was a pay phone on Bank Street I called my mom and dad I got my dad in the phone I said I'm not going to the Virgin is I'm not going to be a director they were terrified I would go back into the service which I actually was thinking about doing cuz being in the service a lot of ways can be rough and you know all that stuff but in other ways it's very easy because you don't have to make decisions about what you're going to wear what you're going to do what you're going to eat and I like that cuz I really am lazy I'm like horribly lazy human being anyway I told my dad that and he took a second and he gave me the best advice I could ever have had he said son I don't really know anything about what you're telling me the only advice I can give you is don't give yourself any deadlines I said what do you mean he said don't say if I haven't made it in two years I'm going to sell insurance he said that's like starting a race with a lead wheel weight hung around your neck in for a penny in for a pound if you love it make it your life and I did and here I am talking to you I'd love to zoom in on your dad for a second because it seems like just based on what you've said thus far that for a company man at that time that seems like very unexpected advice that would be given that there wouldn't be any push back what do you attribute that to why did your dad give you that advice do you think or why did he feel comfortable my dad grew up in a way that I can't possibly understand in real serious poverty I remember he told me at one point if I ever have money I'm going to give it to a charity make it the Salvation Army cuz they fed us Christmas times they had a cow in a vacant lot that blocks of people used for milk so I'm not going to go into I don't want to divulge to but my dad was involved in as hard a life as you can imagine and did well in that life so my dad's background was he dealt with really poor Irish Jewish black Italian and all of them involved in gambling and booze none of them involved in drugs they were all people my dad's best friend would who raised me as much as my mom and dad did was uh black Cherokee super honorable super loving super gentle but also somebody you wouldn't want to [\\xa0__\\xa0] with so that was my dad's background when he met my mom and she said basically if you even curse around me we're not going to be together and you can't do anything illegal so he left the world that he was in and started selling blueo tools that morphed into Snap-on Tools he told me later on when I was still struggl as an actor and the thing that I'm sad about but I can't do anything about it is he never saw me being Su my mom did but my dad was dead by the time but he told me he said when he was started doing really well with Snap On Tools he said I keep running into these men who are lawyers and doctors and they're not happy because they're doing their father's dream not their dream and he said the only advice I can give you about having kids is when you have kids don't dream their dreams for them do not do that so he was an unusual guy to be very honest the only human being I've ever met in my life close to who he was was him thank you for sharing that and how would you describe your mother her character what you absorbed uh from her filled with love unconditional love when I think back on it my mom and dad played tennis my mom also grew up really really poor her dad died when he was in his 30s but she had a rich super Aunt who never gave the family money but gave her things like ballet lessons and so my mom was a dancer and I think back on it she was a loving physical artist it was like when I remember when Carol and I were going to get married and I told my dad that we grew up Sweden borans and I was planning on converting to Judaism I didn't want her to have a Target on her back that I didn't have on mine as well and my dad's answer was man should do what the woman wants so that was my mom and dad I mean what I will say about growing up with them is you hear all these people talk about growing up in these dysfunctional F I don't have any excuses I grow up in the most functionally family straight out love my dad never hit me except for once in my life I remember my mom wanted me to take this girl to a dance Junior High and she was the daughter of a friend of hers and I went oh I know she was little Hefty whatever I didn't want to do it and I said no I don't want to do it and she said please son I'm asking you I said no and my mom teared up and started going my dad walked in the door and he said why is your mom crying I said something I said he walked over and hit me with an uppercut and dropped me on my ass like Wham this is somebody who had never given me a spanking yeah and he looked down at me he said make your mom cry you're going down and walked away so the next time my mom wanted me to do something if she even started to go I said okay Mom I'm do it so let's come back to the conversion to Judaism I'd love for you to say a little bit more about that you mentioned if Carol was going to have a Target on her back he didn't want her to be alone in that can you say more about the decision to convert yeah I had a friend his name was Milton badle and I've lost touch with him I don't even know if he's alive or dead but he was a rabbi and a Sho in the upper e Side in New York and he was a friend of mine he had been a rabbi in a Sho in Charleston South Carolina he'd been in some of the first bus sittings he'd been in shootouts with a KKK and I believe he dropped a couple of those and he was my friend he loved theater and I went to see him and I said I want you to make me a Jew he he he said why say that to him in preparation for getting married yeah I said I'm going with Carol I want you to make me a Jew he met her and he so and I said I want you to make me a Jew and he said schmuck i al for you I'll tell her parents I did it and I won't do it and I want not her parents don't have anything to do with it and he said I'm uh conservative Rabbi I don't really believe in conversions that much what do you know about the tomed and I said if a man teaches his son no trade it is as if he taught him highway robbery and he said you've read the tomet and I said some of it he said do you accept it as the word of God and I went no not really I said it's I think it's a book with a lot of wisdom as is the Bible as is the Quran but if you're asking me of all that stuff what resonates the most with me would be Lau is the way of life he said I'll get I'll find a rabbi that'll do it for you I went okay I started walking out of the sh he said hey wait a minute [\\xa0__\\xa0] turn around so I did and he said you're not doing it for the talmud you're not doing it for her parents why do you want me to convert you and I said because I met this woman I love her and we want to travel and I don't want to be go anywhere in the world where somebody's pointing a gun at her and not at me for the same reason period that's it if there was no anti-Semitism you and I wouldn't be having this talk and he said sit down so I sat down and he said after me all of Beth giml do and I said what are you doing he said I'm converting you and I said you just told me you wouldn't he said nobody has ever given me that answer to that question he said if you want to take this on that way I'm Duty bound to convert you and then kind of converted me I was doing an Off Broadway play at the time so he would go down and when I would go to the Sho to like learn about Judaism he was a closet director he would say I want to come back on stage in two days I want you to try this oh man okay I'm not GNA say no to the guy Abraham Ephraim Ben Abraham is my Jewish name you mentioned Lau why does that resonate why does his writing or the glate known as Lau the of it feels like an honest description of of inner and outer truth the way I know it it just resonates with me that I mean we can talk about this later on or not talk about it you shoot I know do you know who Brian Enos is I know the name I did so he wrote a book called practical shooting Beyond fundamentals and it's about when you enter the space of doing something the less thought that can be involved and the more you're just present in the now the better it will be doing martial arts and boxing wrestling all that stuff I just realized at a very young age that if I wanted something to work out well physically the best thing I could possibly do is watch my body do it not make any decisions at all so you know if somebody does this then you do that I never bought that in martial Arts given where I grew up I knew that wasn't true number one if anybody who predicted what would happen in let's say a physical confrontation if they were making the prediction one thing for me was very clear about them they'd never been in one now I believe that that's not just true of that kind of stuff but it's true of pretty much anything you do physically if you have muscle memory let your muscle memory alone it'll do it so much faster and cleaner than you ever will and for me spiritually that's what Lau is saying so it's this sort of diminishing of the self or dissolution of the self yeah I mean it's like Lau is the ultimate mystical and for me mystical the mystical side of every religion is not the Impractical that's the Practical side the Impractical side is orthodox that says this is a whole other thing and I'm just an actor and I'm not that bright so I'm just saying but I believe that Orthodoxy right now is under Fire and diminishing quickly it's in the rearview mirror and people like Mike Johnson even complain about going to fundamentalist Evangelical Church and seeing less and less people in the pews the reason for that I believe is because Orthodoxy is Not Practical Orthodoxy says take absolute for real the words that are written in these books well if you want to save Orthodoxy forget about banning books about lgbtq or blacks or Latinos you want to save Orthodoxy ban the teaching of these three following subjects math physics chemistry because under the harsh light of science Orthodoxy doesn't work carbon dating says to the Bible the tomod and the Quran all of which get kind of close to the same date as the age of the Earth carbon dating says yeah you miss that one by only around 170 million years whoops somebody lived in the belly of a whale well 2,000 years ago you look at something as big as a whale you say it's possible biology says this thing can barely swallow anything bigger than a minnow guess what it never happened whoops but m iism says all of this is poetry to tell you from God how to live your life how to be an honorable just person how to have a family all of which I completely believe absolutely so to me Lau is the ultimate Mystic because in my mind what Mystics and Orthodoxy are looking essentially at doing the opposite thing Orthodoxy is saying if I bow to Mecca or if I eat fish on Friday or if I live kosher when I die I'll be cool my ego will be cool I'll be fine I will be fine mysticism tries to dissolve the ego altogether do I believe when I die Scott Glenn will be around no but do I believe there's something in me that's a point of view that's a point of view of you two guys and the cloud outside and Elk running yes I do believe that talking about that dissolution from a firsthand experiential perspective like a Mystic have you ever experienced say an acting a role playing you as opposed to the other way around yes could you describe yeah what that's like the first time it happened was Urban Cowboy I translated it wrong I translated as a as fear of leaving this character alone the second time it happened was doing an Off Broadway play called Killer Joe and I just realized that up until one part of Killer Joe it was a crazy play where we were allowed the director realized that the Acoustics were so good in the soo playhouse that we could turn our back on the audience and be heard we could walk off stage and be heard so he thought to make this really spontaneous and organic I'm going to allow anyone to do whatever they want there's not going to be any blocking at all none the whole thing took place in a trailer on the outskirts of Dallas so if as a character you in the middle of a conversation you felt like walking down the hallway off stage to take a leak you did so it was completely open like that the only part that was choreographed originally was the there was a big fight at the end we brought in a guy from the Opera to choreograph the fight and he choreographed a great fight scene but it didn't look right next to how loose the rest of the play was so we realized we had to improv the fight as well merely the people in the cast had circus skills we knew how to Pratt fall and stuff like that but everybody got hurt doing it 15 minutes before half an hour we come on stage and we say okay tonight this chair is a breakway way this will shatter this is real and the deal that we had was like if you came up behind me and grabbed the back of my hair and pulled me I would fall backwards but since I couldn't see what I was falling into it was the obligation of the person pulling me to kick if there was a chair or something that I was going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] up my back to kick it out of the way the only place to kick it was the first aisle of the theater so we told people when they came to see his play this is a project aisle you may not get a heavy object landing on your lap or you may you for sure are going to be covered with fried chicken and ketchup and fake blood there's no question so don't wear suits that you care about so anybody over the age of 25 avoided those seats and the kids fought to get them so that was sort of the way the play worked there was one scene at the very beginning of act two where I'm supposed to walk on it's dark and this guy is trying to get in he's drunk and he's trying to get in the front door but I don't know who it is and I've moved in at that point and I'm in bed with a young girl so I come out in the dark grab him slam him down on the ground and I've got a 45 automatic and I'm wearing a watch and the lights come up and then everybody else wanders on stage who's in the trailer my wardrobe is a 45 automatic and a watch at one point Tracy Le said Scott when people walk on stage all I see is your ass you're trying to you live at this place so full frontal nudity fine but doing that oddly kind of after the first night doing it it was like I don't know whether liberate is the right word but just going to use that word I realized that after that and Tracy forced me into that spot the best thing I could do with the play was just let it happen just let it happen so that was Killer Joe when you say let it happen how does that change how you approach the next performance you decide to let it happen what do you the next performance I didn't make any decisions about what I would do what prop I would pick up anything well let's see what's going on here I'm going to live in this space I know that I am this character I even told Tracy I said I know other people have played this part at Steph of wolf where it started in Chicago but you [\\xa0__\\xa0] wrote this for me and I just know it in the way that that I felt the same way about West high tower and Urban Cowboy so that was Killer Joe the next time it happened I was doing leftovers and I had been in two seasons of The Leftovers and I'd gone from just being a character to Damon LOF calling me up with Mimi leader the producer she directed most of them and Damon wrote it and they said we want you to be a regular member of the cast we're doing the last season in Australia and I think the second or third episode is going to be just you Scott all just you in Australia and I've written the longest monologue I've ever written I'm so lucky so I said what is it two pages long he said no seven I holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] seven pages and he sent it to me at the time he sent it me I was reading this book I know you've got a dog I'm going to ask you about your dog sure but I was reading this book called Don't Shoot the dog excellent book isn't it a great book it is the top recommendation always for people who are considering getting a dog for any type of training it is an excellent if we weren't holding mics I'd hug you so I got so I'm reading don't shoot the dog and the section I'm reading is where she says positive reinforcement can help you train your dog your husband or your wife your friends even yourself for example if you've got something long to memorize and I'm thinking holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] here's so what she said in that was it'll take longer initially but it's the perfect way to memorize something really long start at the end the last sentence and then the last sentence and the next the last sentence and then like that because what will happen when you get to the the beginning of this thing and you launch into it for real as you're getting towards the end it'll become more and more familiar it'll be like walking home wait a minute I know this Street Lamp okay I know where fascinating instead of the ending being this hanging UNAM scares you of while I remember it as you get near the end and you become more and more comfortable and more more comfortable so we get down to Carol and I get to Australia we go to the got back and we're going to do this scene it's the first one we're going to do and so Mimi says we'll do this in bits and pieces cuz this is seven pages there's no way you can do the whole thing in one and I said you know what M can you set it up so that I at least give me a shot at doing in one take and she said yeah okay I can do that so we set up it's really it's not a monologue in that it's not me talking to myself I'm talking to David goil but he doesn't say anything things so he just sits there and listens so we start doing this scene and we come to the end of it I hear action I feel my key light a few times I hear cut and Mimi says Okay that was first she said incorrectly but I'll say it because I get a big ego she said ladies and gentlemen you just had a master's class in acting she said okay so Scott so when you picked up the tape recorder and you started to play it and you wed up and you started to cry and you wouldn't let yourself and you put it back down what did you do next and I said what did I do with the tape recorder she said what do you remember about what you just did and I went not much she said you're telling me that so much of you was in that scene there wasn't enough to step outside you weren't watching yourself at all and I went no and she said if you can't direct yourself I can't direct you so would you be willing to next time we do this to have a little piece of you watching it so that when I talk about parts of the that I want to change we can talk to each other and I said are you asking me as somebody who has this job and has being told by the director or as an an artist she said what's the difference and I said the difference is I'm a blue colar enlisted Marine I know how to take orders you're my boss if you tell me to do it I'll do it but if as an artist you're asking me will I do it artists wait whole lifetimes to be able to have this experience and if I could have this experience again [\\xa0__\\xa0] no I don't want to do it I do not and she said what if I'm not getting what I want I said let's do another take we'll just do one take after another she said it'll wipe you out it'll exhaust you I said no it won't look at me am I exhausted so we did three or four more takes of the whole thing and the end of it Mimi said is this what I'm going to be dealing with for the rest of this episode and I went not if you tell me not to and she said I'm not going to tell you not to let's just go for it so we did that whole episode crazy white fella thinking and all I would do in the morning would I would wake up first in the outback and then later on a melburn was I look literally look in the mirror and I say stay out of the way do not make editorial decisions or try to work for that big moment I had a manager who used to his term was having a conversation with Oscar have no conversations with Emmy or Oscar just stay out of the way of this and let it happen so that was when I really understood being in that spot as an actor and then it happened to me again with Vince vaugh doing a series that hasn't come out yet the first season I don't know if they'll we second season the first season will be around August it's called Bad Monkey it stars Vince and the first day on the set working with Vince we did a i play his dad and the character is a shaman who talks to manate and birds flying by in the sky and [\\xa0__\\xa0] like that at any rate Vince after we did the scene as written like three times and it felt like it was just taking me Vince said okay we know the scene Scott would you be cool with just throwing the script out and just winging that scene what we just did just completely open-ended loose and I went you mean like I used to do in Street Theater [\\xa0__\\xa0] yes and after we did that I just thought I'm not going to edit myself or this character that I'm playing because of a key that kind of something that I signed out for a breathing thing with this guy Iran lur at any I just realized after that day with Vince and the key that I had to play in the character I'm going to stay out of the way of this because it feels so good and so fresh and I'm lazy too I mean it's taking care of me why should I work my ass off when the best stuff is just leaving it alone and then the next job I got after that was something called Eugene the Marine which is this lowbudget thriller that will be coming out sometime in the next year and with that I realized from the GetGo just stay out of the way both because the director was going to let me do whatever I really wanted I would make the physical I'm supposed to pick up a drill and drill a hole in the wall I'd do that but how I was going to do it whether it's going to be the same again and again what it would match I wasn't even going to not even think about that a little bit to a great extent because I am lazy and then the part that I was doing in Eugene the Marine was beyond the lead it was in a 98 page script I was 96 of the pages so there's no way I couldn't even memorize I was just HED that the words would come to me and what I happened on with that was I realized that what gives in my mind what gives performances on film their juice on electricity is their degree of spontaneity and complete spontaneity and I got this from Brian Enos as well about shooting complete spontaneity is not watching yourself at all complete spontaneity is being in the now so completely that you really don't have a past and more importantly way more importantly I think with acting is you don't have a future which means plans on what you're going to do in the scene dissolve and then finally disappear so what I had with that movie was finally would just wound up being with the crew as my very small audience every single take was a one act play called now you mentioned Marlon Brando earlier was there anything that you gleaned from your time around Marlon Brando or that he taught you any gems you picked up aside from his moral Behavior which was phenomenal what do you mean by that he supported two villag in the Philippines with all of his pay and wouldn't let anybody write about it or it's not in the movie but there's one point where I killed Dennis Hopper and I was working on the scene and Marlon came over to me he said Scott just because they call it acting doesn't mean you have to act I went okay what did he mean by that what he meant by that was I was trying to squeeze something out of a moment rather than seeing what the moment was going to present to me and what I learned from watching him was because he had this reputation of being okay there are two basic schools of acting that even to this day that when you watch people work and you know which one they're coming from one is R really great bread actors all have this which is technique you get down the accent and the physical characteristics and the Wardrobe and the makeup and the dealing with props and get the whole outside perfect and then then do the part that's Rada technique acting most of what you still see then there's the Russian school which is stanislowski bosowski and that is you begin with the inside of the character does this person share my same the way I look at life philosophy all that stuff what emotions are really mine that are also this characters and if they're not the same can one be replaced with the other so if something makes me angry about getting on a subway and I'm playing somebody who's angry about not being left money in a will the audience doesn't know where that anger comes from so use the Subway because you're not in the other city so Marlin had the reputation of being mainly if not 100% the Russian school I realized around him he was whatever worked sometimes he would take a mirror make a an expression on the mirror freeze and say action at other times he would say how are they lighting this scene and they would say is there a way I can put this ear in the dark so you don't see it yeah but what are you going to do and he put a sound plug in his ear and play not his lines but the stuff he wanted to cover in improvisation so he wouldn't miss stuff it was audio he had recorded himself so he would do anything and I learned from him that part but I also got from Marlon his understanding about okay so brief little story where we were in the Philippines was in a place called pox andh Han and I had a room at pox andh Han in that I basically kept all my crap in I was living at the time with this group of people called the eagal that were on the set but one afternoon I was back at the hotel with Morin with two producers I think Dennis Hopper and I think Larry Fishburn was there so anyway we're sitting around the table in the hotel and where you check into the hotel and a Juke boox were all kind of in the same room this couple came in to check into the hotel Philipino couple and they had two little girls with them one was holding her mom's dress hiding behind it the other one and I think it was satisfaction was playing on the jukebox the other little girl heard this song and she came dancing into the place where we were all sitting around sort of miming to satisfaction and she was magical and people were laughing and finally their parents checked in they all left and went upstairs one of The Producers I think was great Frederick said about the little girl who was in Dani he said God that little girl was magical someday that little girl will be a great actress and Marlon said great actress and they said he said yeah and Marlin said you're wrong it's the other one they didn't get it but I immediately understood cuz that other little girl doing like this was me who needed the permission of a part to go nuts to do whatever it was and Marlon was saying the same thing about himself with the quickening that you felt when you realized that you were meant to act when your life started to make sense do you think that was predestined out of the box was that informed by experience with scarlet fever because I know I believe you couldn't read at the time yeah scarlet fever attacks sometimes all usually just one of your senses and they don't know why it does that but they were trying to protect my eyesight which turns out to be really good what Scarlett fever left me out with was damaged auditory nerves I mean I've got heing AIDS in now because Carol finally who was up here probably five six years ago she just got tired of screaming at me and having me walk into the room and turning the TV up so like earsplitting loud she said you got to get hearing it didn't think I needed them and then I got checked by the audiologist who went behind my back to talk to me and what happened was he was talking to me I'm looking at him and I'm hearing him fine he walks behind me and I can't hear him and he told me he said that's because you read lips I thought no I don't read lips he said oh yeah you do and he said the good news Scott is this is not age related the bad news is you've been suffering this for at least 40 years my suspicion is longer so uh that was scarlet fever and do you think that informed helped shape you into what later became this actor yeah or it led me into having discoveries that I wouldn't have had before like when I got out of bed from scarlet fever I could take my finger literally and run it in and out of my rib cage my bodess were soft so I limed I grew up in a neighborhood that was very physical so out of mortification if there was a pickup football game I played but what I discovered from playing sports and stuff wasn't that I was so good at it but I actually liked it a lot I loved physicality before I got scarlet fever I didn't all my friends were girls I'd much rather talk about flower arrangements than the NFL or and to some extent that's still true of me so scarlet fever just introduced me to a different world that I really loved Marine Corps did too all of those things rock climbing with Tony Jones up in the Big Horn cracks all that stuff I found out was really fun and put a smile in my face and I don't think if I had never gotten scarlet fever I don't know that that would have ever had I don't know it did happen and now I'm 85 and here it is so for people who of course are listening to this and not seeing any visual ual I mean for the majority of our conversation you were sitting comfortably cross-legged on a couch no back support something that I know 30 something who wouldn't be comfortable in that position more than a few minutes what does your physical training look like now and what would you say are some of the most important types of training or decisions about training that you've made say Post 40 just to allow this type of durability I always wake up the same way I wake up I didn't day oh I slept in but normally I wake up around 5:30 I slept till 7 today I don't know why but I come downstairs I fill up the coffee machine with water turn it on clean up the surfaces of all the tables just because it feels like a good thing to do and then I massage my ears pull them up as high as possible I'm not talking about being gentle not gentle at all pull them down and then massage my ears and if I feel any even slightly tender or sore spot I really go after that as hard as I can I learned this in a Tai Chi seminar years ago in in New York and I've done it ever since but anyway strong super strong ear massage then after that and while I'm doing all this stuff I'm thinking I'm making sure that my breath is horizontal and low what do you mean by horizontal okay there are two kinds of breathing that most people like most Americans do improperly after the age of I don't know two or three one is we're born breathing horizontally which means if I say take a big in a big breath of air your stomach goes out your diaphragm is working right and it's not and you're not bringing anything into the top of your chest at all that's horizontal breathing vertical breathing is where you see the shoulders going up and and we vertically breathe way way too much because what vertical breathing will do aside from the fact that you're not taking in as much oxygen is it will put tension into your upper body and lower body it'll also Jack you into a fight ORF flight situation so if you do that at a stoplight because somebody you know got in your way that's really a bad idea cuz you're going to jack up your heart rate you're going to jack up your blood pressure you're going to screw with your central nervous system so I just try early in the morning try to remind myself horizontal breathing horizontal breathing and then drop it down low so that you're feeling the diaphragm that's all so I do that after the ear massage I tap my head brain tap it now this is also from Chinese medicine yes M so after I finish tapping I wash my hands blow my nose walk outside and I'm dressed usually like this usually I've got a lighter shirt on put shorts and a sweatshirt right now yeah and I slip on these slipon shoes cuz this time of year I'll probably be standing in snow and ice and I open up the garage and I walk outside and I hum and when I say I hum any of us can do it easily you put your back teeth together and I do that eight times and put vibration in my Vegas nerve this is every morning for sure and then I come back in shut the garage door and usually then I look at what the temperature was cuz I think whoa that was pretty cool like this morning it was 14 and you're outside in shorts yeah yeah I'm not uncomfortable at all but you know I know other people who handle the cold way better than I do but the humming you know who does that Buddhist monks do that in the Himalayas and they do that in way Colder Weather with robes on it actually will work if you can do it in a relaxed way you know you start to learn sort of to Anchor your coxics hum come back in then take a shitload of vitamins and minerals and crap like that probably most of which I don't need but I do it anyway and then make the bed up stairs always make the bed and then I do something physical to finish waking up today it was baby fit you know baby fit I do not know baby fit Russian special ops do it in the morning use your legs first five time with each leg lying on your back with your arms over your head use your legs to turn yourself over the way a baby would and then you use your arms to do the same thing five times five times then you rock back and forth I do it 20 times do with your neck I do 10 times usually and then a low crawl and a bear crawl you can either do a bear crawl with your butt up in the air or your butt lower than your shoulders I do it lower than my shoulders did you get John into this and and what he said was makes so much sense we spend so much of our time looking at cell phones and computers and driving and doing so much stuff like that or like that right with your head good to do that a bit get your neck extended instead of so I PCH downward and I do a bear crawl and I like today I didn't do that many because I was thinking about you guys coming over here and I didn't want so I just did 12 but usually I do 60 when it's warm out I'll use the lawn out there and usually it's like 90 to 100 out this is yards or feet feet I guess this is just moves oh okay two three four like that that's quite a bit good for youz I don't even know if I could do that so that's one one thing I'll do the other the other is you know like a really brief warmup when I say brief warm-up 30 seconds of running in place swinging my arm just putting some sovial fluid in my joints and then what I've been doing a lot is quick and dead for me that's just 10 kettle bell swings either with a 32 lb I don't know the kgs in the 30s probably 16 24 kilos wow or 52 52 okay I stopped doing the 52 cuz I screwed up my muscle I'm learning about more muscles in my body with my old age but anyway I do 10 kettle bell swings inside a minute 10 more inside a minute wait a minute get on the ground do push-ups depends on how ambitious I am I I'll either do I rarely do straight push-ups I'll usually do fist push-ups or open finger fish push-ups try finger pushups or these which are oh I got it the closeand more tricep push-ups but yeah right back cerc prison push-ups so I'll do 10 of those 10 of those wait a minute back and forth and I'll do five rounds so inside of five rounds I've done 100 KB swings and 100 push-ups then I'm pretty much done with like specific working out if I want to do I used to do you know work out with like dumbbells and barbells and stuff like that just for the chuckles of it every now and then I'll pick up some dumbbells just to play where say can I still do this but I avoid that because I'm 85 and I don't want to mess with my joints and tendons and ligaments and I've discovered that bands work just as well and they're way more merciful on your body I mean at one point you talk about being 85 I absolutely take into account the fact that I'm and the other thing I realized is that already at 85 my recuperation time is way longer than it used to be if I do an all nighter now it'll take me three days to get back when I was in the Marine Corps I could get I'm not exaggerate I could get 15 20 minutes of sleep just tying myself to an armor personnel carrier and I was good for 72 hours for real and those days are long gone yeah yeah so now also if I drink too much tequila I'm going to really feel it for two or three days all that stuff the one place where that I'm lucky I'm not bragging it's really true is my reaction to I'm still as quick as I used to be but what I'm I realize is that could turn into and for people who can't see you just threw a jab right in my face what I realized is that could drop off 30 seconds from now I'm 85 it's at some point that's going to go and if it does that's I'll deal with it those are some of the stuff that I do aside from the breathing stuff I used to think the most important muscles in the body were the butt the hamstrings and the quads lower body big muscles and there's not on important at all but now I believe that easily the most important muscle you have control I mean I guess yogis have control over their heart so that would work I don't I can slow my heart rate down and that's pretty much it so the most important muscle on my body that I can have control over for sure is the diaphragm nothing else even gets close and that feed up thing over there I used to oh wow yeah look at that I know the feed up I like like forget exactly how the diaphragm feels so I'll I'll invert myself and then drop my heels over so that they're against the wall really gently as gently as possible and why I'm doing that is that I can then take all of the tension out of my shoulders and my hands and everything and then I just start breathing deeply if you're in that position you won't be able to vertically breathe you will not be able to let me just start taking big breaths you're going to be introduced to your diaphragm like right away so let me explain this for folks because a lot of people listening a lot of my friends who are former athletes in their 30s or 40s could not do this comfortably so I want to explain it so imagine there's a device called the feed up but just for visual purposes imagine that you took a let's call it a 3-in cushion and put it on your toilet seat emptied the toilet of water put your head in the toilet and then kick your feet up so you're basically doing a a handstand on your shoulders you can't shrug your shoulders or be very hard so you have to then breathe through your diaphragm so this is what Scott does at 85 just for hashtag life goals for everybody listening and do you exercise every morning no I guess I kind of do I was thinking when I was joining Eugene the Marine all I would do is well actually I did do about 60 pce I would do baby fit in the morning that would be pretty much it cuz I knew I had so much work to do during the day and a lot of it was super physical is martial arts stuff with training knives and stuff like that so I'm not compelled to work out every day but at least every other day and the diaphragm stuff I use because like I say I'm I'm super lazy as an actor so I got this part in Bad Monkey I'm playing this Shaman I get the part and then I can't wa to see this by because I'm thinking how do I play somebody who talks to manate teas and I don't want to I don't want to have to technically figure that out as an actor that's going to be way too much work so sign me up for this thing with this guy named irwan lur who does natural movement you probably know who he is I do he also would concur that the diaphragm was the most important muscle and he was all about breathing and the course was all about breathing and meditation and Iran believes for me it's true it may not be true for other people I don't know but for me it's true that thoughts are either trying to figure out problems which we all do what's how do I get from here to there what's 2 plus 2 equal that kind of thing or it's a conversation that you're writing the script and you're delivering to yourself when you say that you mean these are like the stories you're creating yeah so this is what Iran believes in a breathhold where you feel stress because the stress you ultimately feel when you're holding your breath is you're afraid you're going to die you're not because at a certain point against your will your body will take over and force you to breathe so he believes that if you have one thing to think about and meditate on during that breathhold you can rewire your central nervous system now that sounds like woo woo stuff to a lot of people but for me it actually worked so he said Scott what what kind of conversation do you have are they basically any one thing I said yeah they're minor being pissed off being angry at somebody took my parking place or making up this confrontation that I may never have with a casting person or but they're pissed off so he said I would suggest that one of your meditations be peace go in the other direction so at the end of this course he gave us this thing I've got it on my phone and it's what it is is six breath holds you decide how long you want them to be and they shouldn't be killer but they should be long enough that they're difficult because Z one said keep telling yourself I'm getting stronger and better with and because of the stress there are six and with diminishing amounts of rest between each one and I do those three times a week airan says don't do them in succeeding days cuz it's probably not good for you and so I don't but I do this these breath holds and I started doing them here while I got the part of and I remember at one point this is the part of the I sit upright in bed and I yell whoa and Carol is 2:30 in the morning and Carol says what what and I said I found my man of te and his name he's a french guy his name is irwan lur what I meditate on our peace CL Clarity and focus and when I say Focus I do mean physical Focus like a gun sight I'll pick a tiny spot on the ceiling and as I'm holding my breath I'll focus on that but try to find the place of meditation that just lets me live there and I started off with doing a minute I think I was doing a minute 15 anyway right now I'm doing a minute 40 six yeah performance free will tell you that of record my longest breath hold is 4 minutes and 15 seconds see look might even be longer now I don't know but up here I'm at 140 but what I'm aiming for I would like by the time I hit 86 The Benchmark for me is two-minute breath hols those are real yeah that's very real so uh but I'm at a minute 40 right now but what I was going to say about good luck and this is just pure good luck to the point where I almost just accept it now when I need to learn something the best teacher in the world materializes right in front of me so I I want to ask you about this because it seems like this is going to be a leading question but it's uh an uninformed observation it seems like from LA to Idaho you loosen your grasp on something and then this opportunity this amazing opportunity presents itself for this this career changing role yeah and it seems like that's happened a few times how would you explain that I would like to be some kind of intellectual giant which I am definitely not I'm probably at average maybe a little bit above average intelligence but not much that's not false modesty that's for real I mean if people ask me am I a good shot with a hand gun my honest answer is above average a lot no above average but I'm a really good instructor I can teach anybody probably to expert level how to shoot a handgun am I a good shot with a rifle yes I am can I teach people well how to no I'm the world's worst teacher I don't do anything right I don't get a consistent spot well and I I don't do any of this I just been doing it since I was so young I just do it and it works out my great fortune in life and I used to be amazed by it now I just accept it is okay I got into the actor Studio by accident and I got by accident Lee straber as my own personal Standalone teacher and Coach the best in the world i' never plann on that happening it just happened I'm out at the rain shooting guy next to me is watching me shoot and he says you're pretty good at doing this but I could give you some pointers come on over to my house tomorrow and I'll show you what I know his name was John Shaw world champion Kurt jnad calls me up when I'm in LA and says you want to know about combat shooting that's not military but the real civilian stuff LAPD sis come on out to the Eagles Nest and meet this guy Scotty Reeds and we become we took a course we become really good friends and he the real deal he's my teacher I'm down the Baja this is how stupid I truly am I'm down the Baja and for two years I've been scuba diving without any instruction and I should be dead I use my BC at almost 100 fet to Rocket myself to the surf so I'm so I'm in this bar and I've just spent a day doing this oh man and I'm talking about it like I'm the coolest person to ever Liv and this guy walks up to me and 60s pop belly guy and he looks at me and he said you're a real [\\xa0__\\xa0] and for whatever reason I don't know if it was in his what about him saying that to me but I came to attention and I said why sir and he got a big grin and he looked at me and he said okay your Army Airborne or Marine which one and I said Marine cor sir and he laughed and he said I'm here with my girlfriend I'm staying in that room you show up tomorrow and give me the next six days of your life show up tomorrow with coffee at 8:45 not before not after and I'll teach you how to scuba Di and certify you and then he walks out of the bar and the owner of the bar just guy John Ireland walks over to me and I tell him about it he said do you have any idea who that was and I said no he said that was James Stewart I said Jim Stewart Jimmy Stewart the actor he said no like Jim Stewart Dive Master ameran at scrips Institute Jim Stewart who wrote the syllabus for the seal themes Jim Stewart who's the only person who can signed the chit that says you're allowed to dive in the Antarctica Jim Stewart whose nowy card is number one and Jo Casto said is arguably the greatest scuba diver they ever lived that's who's going to teach you and certify you and he did I mean so I mean it's again again I'm out of skill I'm out I'm out here in the summertime and I'm talking about what does the feel like to be a bird because when I was in the service I never freef fall I never did freef fall like him and like SF and seals do at all but I've done static line jumps so I'm telling somebody at this cocktail party this guy walks up to me and he said you want a freef fall I'll teach you come over to my house tomorrow afternoon I'll hang you in front of my porch I'll teach you malfunctions and major malfunctions and how to deal with them and we'll go jumping and I said why should I trust you and he said because I'm four times world champion I'm the only person allowed to videotape the golden knights if you know anything about jumping videotaping skydivers is the easily the most dangerous part because of all the stuff you can me it's all the things can go wrong yeah so I said are we going to tand and jump he said no you already told me you you're a static line jumper we'll put a 2x4 on a cesma we'll go up we'll use the 2x4 to launch ourselves out on the strut of the wing hang on to it he said you'll go first I said what will you do he said I'll come after you he said just you jump off and establish a hard Arch and he showed me how to do that and I said okay but then what do I do and he said well I'll jump off catch up with you I want you to panamine but don't do it panamine pulling your rip cord and you'll yell to me what your altitude is we'll go out hopefully 15,000 and when you hit 3,000 you don't panim anymore you actually pull the rip cord and pump air into the cells of the parachute and that's the way it'll work and it did it worked that way perfectly cuz he was so good he would bullet dive down and be as far from me as I am from you right now like four feet three feet I mean again and again and again the best person's not like oh this person's kind kind of good at what they do they're as good at it as anybody on the [\\xa0__\\xa0] planet Earth and they're going to teach you and the one thing I will say and hopefully whoever is hearing this will take it to heart there's part of me that's really a good student and here's the part of me that's really a good student I'm willing to fall on my ass in front of people the embarrassment of screwing up and being clumsy and falling on my ass in front of people is not great enough to keep me from doing it and that's the trick to being a good student yeah I heard someone say recently Fair High performer I'm blanking on the attribution but they were taught by a mentor something and I'm paraphrasing but they said in order to be excellent at anything you have to first be willing to be extremely crappy at it that's so true I mean it's like with Marshalls you've done them enough so I know I'm talking to somebody the two of you guys understand this okay so I'm going to Thailand to do this TV show White Lotus that I I can't really talk about it because they're very secretive but I'm going to be in Thailand so I called up a friend and just because I love the word KRA Kong I mean it's so cool K kbong little babies probably like saying it too but it's a Thai martial art and it's the weapons side of mu Thai when you're really good at it you use razor sharp double swords but when you begin it it's just retan sticks and what I want to do in Thailand is not learn kraby Kraang or be taught secret moves or any of that I just want someone to show me the absolute basement seller Foundation what are the moves that you need to be able to I know they won't be complicated I know there'll be something that with just pure repetition I can do again and again so that's what I'm going to do when I get to Thailand and you've done a lot I mean you've done a lot of knife work also I imagine that some of the KN stuff I yeah actually do movement patterns probably translate really well one thing you should definitely try to do while you're there if you can is go to lumini Stadium or rajad dnan to watch the myay thae fights I've been to both of those you have I there I did a film in Thailand this as an actor I've been in Thailand a few times but I was there as an actor doing a movie called off limits and it was the King's birthday and he was turning 60 and if you know with a lesser vehicle Buddhism you become an adult at 60 it's the end of the fifth cycle C 12 years yeah so his birthday was all year long and we lost locations and so my week and a half or two week job wasn't going to happen for at least two months so I said to them why don't you just keep me here in a hotel rather than spend first class playing tickets back and forth back and I bring Carol over and we can go to pukat and have fun so we did that but while I was there the movie is kind of a sad movie to me because two of my friends who were in the movie who play much bigger Parts than me are no longer alive one was Gregory Hines who I loved and Gregory I knew from martial arts from doing Korean martial arts in New York he was really good at it he's the only person I ever saw he on his passport you know where you put occupation his said tap dancer he was amazing he died of liver cancer and the other was Fred Ward who died of Alzheimer's but Fred was Fred was an amazing athlete Fred had a a silver boot in box F savat saat yeah and when he was in Thailand he trained me mu Tha with the people from arajan and oh yeah and so he brought me well at one point remember he brought me into work out with those guys I wouldn't hit palm trees with my hands or anything like that but they they had heavy bags and stuff like that too you know and Fred told me that God gave me a right hook and I said yeah I know that part but we went Fred and I went across the border illegally into what was then Burma in the up in the Golden Triangle at danger area three pagota pass yeah so I had had adventures in Thailand and saw a lot of mu Tha yeah oh yeah the art of eight limbs beautiful and brutal and very effective art I want to revisit for a second this luck because there's luck different degrees of luck and a lot of it's outside of your control but it seems like there's certain ways you can increase the surface area in your life that luck can stick to and one is by being a good student for instance that increases the likelihood that luck is going to stick to you are there any other recommendations you would have for people who want to increase the type of serendipity and luck that you've experienced are there any other ingredients that you can play with if you have the Good Fortune to fall in love with and find yourself with a Jewish girl from Brooklyn don't fight her about anything because number one you're going to lose and number two she's going to take you in a much better Direction than you ever figured let's go go deep down that rabbit hole then so relationship we've talked about career we've talked about some Fitness long durable good relationships with a partner any advice for people out there cuz especially in your I would imagine in the world of entertainment this is a rarity I would have to think from the outside looking in again it was my good fortune to just fall completely in love with this woman how did the two of you meet in a movie theater in New York the girl I've been kind of not really living with but semi living with off and on and I had broken up and she just tried to kill herself and uh I had a friend who who now is teaching school in Iraq of all places his name is Jeff sigin at anyway he called me up and he said we're going to the movies Murray Hill Cinema me and a group of people are going want to come with us and I said sure So Carol was one of them I'd never met her before I sat next to her in the movie theater and I just felt these W I didn't touch her or anything I just felt these waves of I don't know what it was but something and I'd fallen in lust probably at least a couple thousand times in my life and pursued that you know with full Vigor but I never really fallen in love anyway so the movie came to an end and everybody got up to leave and for whatever reason I turned to Carol and I said I think I want to sit through this and watch it again she said yeah me too do so we sat through the whole movie again not even touching and the movie came to an end and in that period of time it was like magical we walked out of the theater and there was probably half a foot of snow everywhere so we went out and we played in the snow it was getting late and Carol said and I was doing a play but I was off that night she said you want to spend the night and I said yeah oh yeah so I went over and she cooked spaghetti and meatballs and we had beer and at the end of dinner she went into the bedroom came out with a pillow threw it on the couch and said this is a turns into a bed their blankets on it have a good night went back into the bedroom shut the door and went to sleep I went okay so the next morning we had breakfast and we played in the snow some more and I was going to say goodbye to her and I thought I'm not going to even try to hug her and kiss her cuz if I do this and she does one of those pull ways my whole world will collapse how I knew that I don't know so I said I had a really good time and the held of my hand I shook her hand goodbye and then for the next week I would open my I had a predictably a little black book and I would open it up and I would call a phone number and a young woman would answer hello hello and I wouldn't say anything and I would just hang up and I went through one and and finally I thought who you kidding you want to see her that's who you want to see so I called her up and I told her my TV was broken and there was something I wanted to watch on television that Saturday night I think it was and she said okay so I get down to her apartment she's got makeup on she's all dressed up and she's oh I've got a date tonight but you know where the fridge is and there's the there's the TV and so have knock yourself out and I sat literally 2 fet away I was so pissed off I was just [\\xa0__\\xa0] really pissed off if I had been a dog I would have been growling yeah so I'm looking at the T I'm not watching the TV and I hear the downstairs Bell go and I hear Carol say I remember the guy's name to this day Earl she said okay Earl I'll buz you in and I'm looking at the TV and I'm hearing the front door open and I'm hearing Earl say whoa you look hot tonight and I hear Carol say listen Earl an old friend of my brothers just dropped by I haven't seen him in a long time I'm not going out with you tonight you can see the emotion I'm filled with right now you can that went yes she shut the door walked into the living room and that was about 55 years ago wow incredible what would car I'll add to this Genesis story if she were sitting here with us what else would she add tell me I was full of [\\xa0__\\xa0] and wrap it up and you got you got shopping to do for me today I'll this I'll say about her because she's not here right now and I've seen it with enough people and what it is about her I I don't know and maybe I don't want to know but even with he's no longer alive but I remember when she and I first met Freddy Fields who was the toughest hardest ass agent Hollywood as old school has ever seen within 10 minutes of meeting her he desperately wanted her approval I've never seen anybody around her who doesn't want her to say you're okay what is that about her she comes from I think now it's 30 35 unbroken generations of Jewish rabbis and Israeli airor whatever I don't know maybe that's part of it but that is true about her people want her to say they're okay what that quality is in her I don't know but it's there that's for sure she amazing funny she is funny you know and doesn't take seriously a lot of the stuff I do and laughs at it and keeps sort of like properly puts me in my place I have to ask and I may get the name wrong here you mentioned Gregory Hines you spent some time at least as I understand it a brief but intense period with modern dance I think and let's see if this goes somewhere playing pool with nuv in New York City is my game the name right no that was I I was dancing with a guy named Matt Maddox who was phenomenal and I remember at one point I said how do I get better at this it was when I quit Dancing almost allog together he said stop acting stop doing martial arts stop wrestling working out don't do anything else just dance you want to get better you're at that point right now and I quit Dancing because I couldn't go all in I ran into nuev while we were doing the right stuff in San Francisco in New York City Ballet had moved to San Francisco for the year and I met him and he had seen Urban Cowboy and he's told me that I was a much realer better Cowboy than John troler would ever be and by the way John travola pretty much sucked as a Dancer too so I remember at one point we were down in the basement of this place called tusas a bar in New York I mean I'm sorry in San Francisco they had a pool pool table fam and we were shooting pool and drinking me in a minor way he in a major way vodka I remember at one point I said to him well you Russians can really hold your vodka and he stopped got really angry and looked at me and he Saidi am not Russian and I said what are you he said I'm laan that was the first time it ever dawned on me that these parts of Russia that I thought were kind of along with Putin were actually Russian were more like Ukraine they had their own identity their own sense of who they were and it meant something and certain he did to Nua he was in in the some ways the best physical shape of any human being I've ever been around I watched him go down a flight of long stairs on his hands I mean he was he would invite me to come and watch the New York City Ballet work out and the makarava who was the best prier ballerina in the world at the time I would watch her on point not coming down from point spinning One Direction three directions four back and forth chain smoking two camels at the same time it was the weirdest world because it was a world where there was Zero Fitness in that way and yet they were the outrageous athletes I mean like stuff that triple back black belts and shodon couldn't even dream about doing these people did easily I did want to talk about poetry if that's possible okay sure I believe you've written a fair amount of poetry what is the and we already spoke earlier a bit as we were discussing Judaism of these scriptures as poetry SLP Parables for living yeah what does poetry mean to you why write poetry why read poetry poetry to me is the along with physical art scratching on the side of a wall this is one of one of your books friction Zone it's the most Elemental way that human beings have to communicate ideas and feelings real deep ideas and feelings and also because as I said I grew up with probably but I don't want to know for sure the myth that I'm directly related to Lord Byron who had a club foot was crippled but swam the helis Bon and fought in Greeks war of Liberation from turkey and he did all this stuff and was you know an outrageous coxman and mainly he was a poet so I've lived with the belief that I have that in in me but what happened with Carol was I wrote a poem to her every Christmas Hanukkah time and at a certain point on her 50th Anniversary she said I want to publish these is it okay with you and I said correctly it's not up to me I'm not a I can say Indian giver because I've got commane blood him so I don't mind using the word if I give something it's yours it's not mine you can rip up those p and wipe your ass with it so she said well I'm going to publish it self-publish so that was room service that's not that book and then during the pandemic there was no acting happening anywhere and then right after that I had a brief period of time when I could work and then the the strike happened but during the pandemic which was about two years long all I could really do aside from work out and hang out with Carol was WR poetry and I wouldn't even know if I would call it observations I leave it to other people to say whether that's poetry or not I don't know but the thing about the pandemic that I realized with relationships is a lot of people who were in love with each other had to discover whether they liked each other or not it's so true and what I discovered with Carol was I liked her better than anybody I knew even to this day we're like aurob Hermits we have no problem I don't need the company of anybody anyway that friction zone is kind of what came out of the pandemic and it's not big heavy duty you know friction zone is friction zone is where you want to be with a big heavy motorcycle like a Harley-Davidson to drive it slowly you're slipping the clutch constantly slipping the clutch with a little bit of power on the so the metaphor for that just anyway how do you apply that metaphor outside of riding a motorcycle like that trusting that your body will do the right thing so when you're riding a say a big Harley I can tell you this atically when you're driving a big Harley and you're going over 25 miles an hour you ride like any other motorcycle if it's a street bike just remember the following dictum front brake until you're really sure of about how it works only stay away from the rear braake dirt bike the opposite if you're going under 25 M hour if you're going under 12 mil an hour you keep the power on slipping the clutch and you will go where your head looks if you look down at the ground I guarantee you you're going to dump the bike I like the metaphor so we're going to wrap this up I'm wondering just as a way of Landing This Plane and wrapping up what advice let's just say 10 years from now your grandkids are listening to this and they're wondering what life advice I would give them both the lessons I learned from Sir Lawrence and from my dad which is if you love it make it your life right along with that be tenacious learn that the most important thing about being knocked down is getting back up and if you can put yourself in the spot where you say I don't care how many times I get knocked down I'm getting back up every single time and going after what I want that's the answer I mean again I'm at a bar with Lawrence Olivier who created the National Theater of England who was the biggest movie star in the world was the most creative stage actor in the world and director he' done everything my question to him was what is it that you need to make it in this business is it timing right place at the right time is it contacts knowing the right people or is it just working on your skills and becoming better and better at what you do he said my dear boy none of the above develop very strong jaw muscles learn how to bite on and not let go I said you're telling me it's just pure tenacity his answer was yes if you're a monk outside the gates with a Beggar's bll and you stay out there long enough they'll finally get sick of seeing you open the gates and lay you [Laughter] that is fantastic Scott thank you so much for taking the time thank you what fun I blabbed away a lot that's the whole point that's that's the whole blueprint and uh you know maybe we'll get a chance to go out and shoot again and for those people listening I think a little birdie told me that with open sights you can still hit targets at 400 yards maybe Beyond I don't know about there was a time in my life and I have witnesses that because it sounds out I could with steel sights hit 600 yard whether I can right now at 85 probably not but who knows I you know I get the dragon off down in warm weather I'm going to I'll give it a shot to use a horrible horrible metaphor well I'm curious to see if I can get my ass upside down on the feet up after this after being inspired by your daily routine so thank you so much for the time hey guys this is Tim

to you by element spelled l m NT what on Earth is element it is a delicious sugar-free electrolyte drink mix I've stocked up on boxes and boxes of this was one of the first things that I bought when I saw covid coming down the pike and I usually use one to two per day element is formulated to help anyone with their electrolyte needs and perfectly suited to folks following a keto low carb or Paleo Diet or if you drink a ton of water and you might not have the right balance that's often when I drink it or if you're doing any type of endurance exercise mountain biking Etc another application if you've ever struggled to feel good on keto low carbo paleo it's most likely because even if you're consciously consuming electrolytes you're just not getting enough and it relates to a bunch of stuff like a hormone called aldosterone blah blah blah when insulin is low but suffice to say this is where element again spelled l MNT can help my favorite flavor by far is citrus salt which as a side note you can also use to make a kickass no sugar Margarita but for special occasions obviously you're probably already familiar with one of the names behind it Rob wolf r o BB Rob wolf who is a former research biochemist and two-time New York Times bestselling author of The Paleo Solution and wired to eat Rob created element by scratching his own itch that's how it got started his Brazilian jiu-jitsu coaches turned him onto electrolytes as a performance enhancer things clicked and Bam company was born so if you're on a low carb diet or fasting electrolytes play a key role in relieving hunger cramps headaches tiredness and dizziness sugar artificial ingredients coloring all that's garbage unneeded there's none of that in element and a lot of names you might recognize are already using element it was recommended to be by one of my favorite athlete friends three Navy SEAL Teams as prescribed by their Master Chief Marine units FBI sniper teams at least five NFL teams who have subscriptions they are the exclusive hydration partner to Team USA weightlifting and on and on you can try it risk-free if you don't like it element will give you your money back no questions asked

optimal minim at this altitude I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking can I ask you a personal question now we a see the broken time what if I did the opposite I'm a cybernetic organism living dissue over metal [Music] endoskeleton hello boys and girls ladies and germs this is Tim Ferris welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferris show and this is one of my favorite types of episodes of course I'm speaking to world class performers of all different disciplines all the time but one of my favorite people to ask for advice is Seth Goden and this is a Walkin talk which means Seth and I were walking and talking while we recorded this and I had many burning questions I wanted to ask he did not fail to deliver a lot of sage advice tactical practical wisdom and what more can I say the guy's a gem he delivers every time who is Seth Goden you might ask Seth Goden is the author of 21 International bestsellers that have changed the way people think about work his books have been translated into 38 languages and Seth's books include tribes Purple Cow lynchpin the dip and this is marketing Seth writes one of the most popular marketing blogs in the world 8500 8,500 plus daily blog posts just to put that into perspective and two of his TED Talks are among the most popular of all time he is the founder of the alt MBA the social media Pioneer squid do and yo-yo dine one of the first internet companies his latest book is the song of significance a new Manifesto for teams you can find him at Seth golden.com and you can find Seth's blog at seth. blog so you can go to both of those for a lot of resources and I'm going to just reiterate why we did this format the way we did it because there's too much sitting in the world it's not good for you we weren't evolved to do it and I am trying to counteract the trend the impulse all the incentives to do podcasts in a fixed location this isn't good for my health and it's certainly not good for your health to force you to consume it that way so I'm at least experimenting with being out and about doing something that we are designed to do and that is walk so without further Ado please enjoy my wide ranging conversation where I ask for a lot of help from Seth Goen all right here we are so thank you again for taking the time and the subject I suppose relates to time attention all these good things which is how to make Tim Ferris is incredibly long form writing shorter or how those two things fundamentally are different in terms of long and short I texted you asking if there's any Secret Sauce any tips or tricks for writing short blog posts because I consider you the Undisputed King of consistently good short blog posts and that kind of Uncorked all of this so here we are and uh I suppose where I might want to start is with our initial text thread and one of the points that at least as I read it seemed to resonate was treating blog posts more as a question than an answer or a provocation rather than a prescription could you expand on that a little bit because I think it relates also to the post that you so kindly proof read where I may have misinterpreted how best to think about that I would be delighted to dive in there are so many places to start I'm going to start with this you are a gifted and generous writer and you have been since I began tracking what you do and blogging is inherently a generous act because it's hard in 2024 to justify it as a financial Endeavor you're doing it to illuminate and what does it mean to write in this form a short story attributed to Ernie Hemingway probably not for sale baby shoes never worn six words it's perfect in six words your heart breaks that's not scalable practical repeatable you can't sign up to write six word short stories that break people's hearts every day because that level of condensing that level of being able to get at the heart none of the words had more than seven letters none of the words have more than two syllables that's magic right we can't repeatedly do that so when we look at the form of a Blog we say well you know Seth's blog posts have 100 to a thousand words in them all I have to do is take my idea and make it shorter and when we try to do that resistance kicks in pressfield's resistance and we say but I need to clarify this sentence and add a parenthetical to that sentence or else I will be misunderstood so this first sentence in this paragraph which is Rich and detailed and recursive and layered goes like this growth agents have a place in medicine parentheses some types of hypop poopari inis wasting syndromes diseases surgical care Etc and some sports effectively require them at higher levels but there are always trade-offs when you turn on the dials on complex hormonal Cascades and feedback loops y everything in that is true and someone could study that sentence in college for a month because there's layers below layers below layers and unfortunately the blog reader in general is not ready to consume that level of condensation mhm and so we shouldn't even try because that's not what a Blog is good at mhm what a Blog is good at is what Scott McLoud taught us about Comics Scott mccloud's book about Comics which is a must read I have read it or understanding Comics is the one that I read understanding Comics thank you yes the key lesson is this Comics work because something happens between the panels uh right and panel one Superman sees a problem in panel two Superman is with the villain we don't see how Superman got from panel one to panel two that happened in our brain so the reason Bad Comics and bad graphic novels are bad is because the Creator didn't understand that they didn't let our brain do the leaping they just decided to add a lot of pictures to a story that would be better in words so what a blog post does is it says here's a sketch over here and now I'm over there you figure out how I got from here to there and by you figuring it out the reader you will grow you will explore you will be a voice in this dialogue it is not just me talking MH so when you ask me to review your writing some people are tempted to proofread and they don't really mean proofread they mean copy edit and copy editing means fix the errors and what I'm trying to do when I'm editing a friend work is say are they even asking the right question cuz they can fix their own errors they don't need my help to do that and so here what I'm trying to say is what is this post for and what it's for I think is to help someone who's not paying attention to realize that there are seven things they might want to think about and seven is a lot so what I pitched back to is this is actually seven blog posts in a series and what the first one says is you know there's some things you're not thinking about that you might want to think about here's one of them and the idea if I just say to somebody biceps are temporary baseball helmet sizes are forever they visualize that immediately MH and then they're like H what and then they want to think about what you meant by that it's a ha cou it's a puzzle it's a shadow where is the light and what is being reflected so now you gotten permission to tell me in a paragraph or two what you meant and then I can you get to say and I say and that is the form that is what blogs are good at but and I'm going to end my rant now the downside is you will be misunderstood and that is why there are no comments on my blog because people who misunderstood a post would then respond by making me feel bad so I would over right and overwrite so they wouldn't do that anymore and then it wasn't a Blog anymore so I had to stop and basically what I'm saying is if you don't get it ask a friend and if they don't get it either come back tomorrow and we can discuss a new thing and I think the king of this is actually the magic of XKCD which is a Blog in graphic form yeah it's outstanding I agree on that and as you're talking a few things come to mind for me and maybe as a backdrop the for a lot of this for me at least is number one to get back into writing and to experiment with a new form a new style a new approach to writing and number two is to explore ideas to explore ideas in various ways to clarify my own thinking Y which ended up happening in this short piece the no biological free lunch piece that you proof read I suppose my question not copyedited which is certainly a very different thing in this particular case if you were writing this would you be inclined to make it a series or would you make each of these a standalone piece in other words of those seven bullets as you're thinking through not just the word count right this is my mistake where I basically said okay instead of writing a 5,000 word blog post I'm gonna make it less than a thousand but I'm G to try to still somehow get all of the concepts into this shorter form seems like there's a conceptual con straint that makes things powerful but would you take those seven make them into an interrelated series would you make them all kind of independent after you introduce them in this one piece how would you think about divvying this up conceptually for yourself and I should also just add one more thing which is yeah fundamental to all of these observations and questions and goals and dreams of mine is how do I make this sustainable for me right which is part of the feedback you gave in the comments on on the draft of this blog post was I'm paraphrasing but if you try to just make the 5,000 words thing a th000 words it's going to be exhausting for you and most likely also exhausting for your readers which I agree with this about genre so my blog is a long running series it has been a series of 8,500 Daily Posts so if I was starting today I have to figure out what is the genre of my work if you think about David Letterman TV show mhm he needed to have a series called stupid pet tricks cuz the show wasn't stupid pet tricks but there was a regular recurring stupid petrick right the show was a series of David Letterman shows so if your genre as you reenter blogging is uh there is a post from Tim on a regular basis and all of them are about the things we put into our body and performance that you're fine if that's not the case then the question is when the reader shows up do you need to do a lot of throat clearing to get them back on track for what you are writing about today and so since you're starting with largely a blank slate I said well if the first seven of these are in this series then you only have to clear your throat once on the 8th day and say okay now we're talking about this and you could do one of those or six of those or 12 of those mhm but people do better if they understand that they're going to see Dune not read the power broker those are different genres and you need to give them a hint as to what they're going to get I like the idea of recognizing that my tendency is to how should I be generous with myself be comprehensive was gonna say over complicate but let's be nice try to be comprehensive I would rather as we talked about earlier I'm walking by tennis court right now and I remember taking a tennis lesson and I kept hitting the ball into the net and the coach said to me he's like you can do anything now next step you can hit the ball straight up in the air you can hit a home run the one thing you cannot do is hit it into the net and I was like okay I got it and I kind of feel like I need to give myself some marching orders like that for writing to counterbalance some of my Tendencies so I like the idea of writing self sustaining independent pieces to restrict myself from the desire to say you know what I'm not going to overwrite this but it's going to be part one in a 12p part series which is uh maybe a workaround uh for tricking myself I'm gonna interrupt you for a little bit the please do you are extraordinarily skilled at not over complicating your writing or your narratives that's how you got this far that there's very little that you have published where you were the primary researcher and the Breakthrough creator of the original science what you've done is helped people simplify understand what's Happening Here is resistance you are adding parentheticals to protect yourself 100% MH so what I'm pushing you to do is to come up with boundaries so that you can say I did a good job and ship the work now that could involve having very like the rules of ha cou very significant rules where you must have a tagline to come online that's less than 18 wordss and you are allowed to have two footnote links but the rest of it has to be a narrative that you would say to somebody on the telephone and instead of typing them you are just recording each one and letting someone on your team type them if that would be the model you would have to let go of it because you only have a 5-minute phone call you're going to say it as clearly as you can you can add two links when you're done and it's done you got to ship it right but that's not letting the reader down because you've announced to them that that's what this is the genre matters I asked you one question related to how you know when you're done and I'd love for you to answer that again because I suspect I'll have some follow-up questions and either before or after that I would love to know for yourself what typee of rules you have imposed or constraints SL boundaries when you have had your better streaks of writing let's just say all right well we I'll do the first part first because it's easier you asked how do you decide or no when a post is done and I texted back I don't that's the point and then I wrote imagine how hard it would be to have a conversation or even a text thread if we had to Think Through whether our turn to talk was over before we stopped talking right so my model my ritual is I write blog posts in advance and then the night before I review them I rewrite them I delete them so if I get the stomach flu there's still going to be a blog post tomorrow and when I rewrite a blog post the rule is you wa get points if you make it shorter you don't get points if you make it longer and if I can't boil it down more than it already is and it's not deliberately deceptive it's done because the purpose is tell people something they already sort of know in a way that they would be grateful for the chance to forward to other people can you say that one more time Seth that seems important if I can show up with something in your bones you know to be true or interesting or worth thinking about but I can say it in a way that would benefit you if you could share it with your friends and colleagues that's a great blog post benefit you in what possible senses I will give you a trivial one first which is more than once I have blogged about how stupid it is that there's a pull down menu when you're checking out of a shop and there's all 50 states listed that isn't helping anybody we have have ai that can speak English it knows how to turn NY into New York and we do this because 40 years ago or whenever the web was young 25 years ago it was a hack that made life slightly easier for certain programmers and it's just been sticking around ever since there are people like me it really vexes and if I say this and you are one of those vexing people now you can forward it to your Web Master and say see see I said we shouldn't this and so I just gave you a useful thing to share that's trivial but that's sort of the idea is that if you have a brother or a son or a colleague or daughter or a sister who would benefit from the Insight that you think I'm on to you're going to forward it to them and you're going to have a connection with them CU I opened the door and made it possible for you to do that every once in a while I do post something about Claude AI that you didn't know know about and know you go oh great I use Claud thank you very much but that's not really the service my blog offers the service my blog offers is not I'm breaking news it's I am trying to illuminate things that already resonate with people not to add too many parentheticals to this conversation but what is CLA but what is Claude AI Claude AI I can't believe I know something you don't know claw. a is significantly better then chat GPT at certain functions and I think part of it is cuz it doesn't read the web or it says it doesn't read the web so it's not easily distracted but I'm launching a software project in six weeks and the business plan took more than a year and a whole bunch of contributors it's 40 pages long and I uploaded the business plan to Claude And I said please review this highlight contradictions paradoxes and obvious errors and in less than 10 seconds it me a page and a half MBA quality memo that nailed it it just nailed it nailed it nailed it and I was like okay you got me that's great that's great so I use Claude AI every day to read other people's writing my writing critique it give me Insight you could send your post to Claude and it might not have the Insight I had but it would definitely have something to say incredible all right well end parenthesis what are some other elements or practices or constraints or fill-in the blank that have helped you with consistency in terms of blog writing because I have attempted and failed a number of times to build up momentum writing shorter posts and I think a lot of what we've already discussed will help is there anything else that you would add to the it helped my consistency streak category well I would say two things first I think you're talking about consistency in terms of showing up at the Ballpark every day Cadence yeah exactly yeah so I'll do that one second the first one I have never met Larry David but I am guessing that there are some days that Larry David is actually a nice thoughtful person and there is a character named Larry David as well so the person who writes my blog is a character named Seth Goden and I am the only person who has ever written my blog I the only person who ever will write my blog but when I am doing it I am playing the character named Seth goed so if it doesn't sound like me if it's just me authentically being tired or annoyed I don't publish those because that's not what my character would do it's this is not me exposing some mystical mythical Seth Goden to the world it's me portraying the character Seth Goden CU it's a service and then the second thing is streaks are usually used against us by software and if they make you feel bad it's not a helpful thing but I write blog posts every single day whether I use them or not and I learned that from Isaac azimov when I worked with him all those years ago if you know that tomorrow morning you have to start typing tonight when you go to sleep or today when you're walking around you will be noticing things so that you have something to type and you know I've have enough in reserve that I don't have to do it every day but I do it every day because I eat lunch every day and because I take a shower every day two follow-ups so the first is related to the playing the character of Seth Goden it sounds like if I heard you correctly you're saying your writing should reflect how you feel in the world at the time that you're writing am I hearing that correctly no it's it's the opposite of that it's the opposite there's no should here first of all if someone wants to write a blog that's just the unvarnished version of them in the moment go for it I don't care I'm not the blog police what I'm saying is I can read a blog post I wrote 14 years ago and I might not write the same one today but it rhymes with the one I would write today because there's a voice that this character has that I am very comfortable with I did the first thing that all writers do when I got chat GPT which is I asked it to write like me and I was pleased to discover it was a parody of me and being able to be parodied is a really good sign and that's what it is to have this voice is to say I could exaggerate it in six different directions and people could tell I would be parodying it but like you know the Peanuts comic strip Charles Schultz did it every single day and it's very hard to tell which decade a peanut strip is from totally and that's that's what I'm after so just to unpack that a little bit more I know we've talked before or I should say I've asked and listen to you discuss how the authenticity fetishizing that goes on is often not always but often very misplaced and just kind of overvalues this oversharing what are the things that make Seth the character Seth the character is it 80% voice that you've developed such that chat GPT can imitate you and Par to you what are the other ingredients that make Seth the character who writes on Seth's blog you know I've not ever pushed myself to name them because seeing is forgetting the name of what one sees but yeah I guess I'd highlight a couple things the first one is I try to begin from a place of the benefit benefit of the doubt of there probably aren't bad people there's just situations that cause people to do things that are troubling and a level of optimism to go with it I try to reduce ideas to their Essence without becoming hyperbolic because the voices of social media amped up the hyperbolic part that's not a simplification that's an exaggeration right I try to eliminate parentheticals unless I really have no choice so I will avoid saying something like all tall people are very brave because that's ridiculous but I will not write tall people or Brave parentheses except for this person this person this person and this person because now it's not worth reading right so there's an assertion at the beginning that creates a t and then a release of that tension that lands an idea so the shortest blog post I ever wrote which I'm really proud of is first line is you don't need more time so that's an assertion it's controversial people who feel overwhelmed want to challenge it and then the delivery is you just need to decide so that flips it upside down takes the blame off off the system and the people who are making you busy and puts it right back on you giving you agency and authority and responsibility to Simply decide and then get back to what needs to get done and so in just a few words that's an example of a short Seth Goen blog post and a longer one is one where I will try to teach somebody details about something they didn't know but frame it in a way that they're comfortable with because that's how they might have framed it as well let me ask a quick question and maybe that I've cut back on my caffeine too significantly but you don't need more time you just need to decide what are people deciding well folks who say I'm going to figure out which college I want to apply to soon I just need to do more research I just need to think about it I got it right close the open Loops get it done make a decision exactly mhm that makes a lot of sense just a quick

have discussed it what are some other things you picked up from Isaac azimov I mean this guy's a demigod at least a lot of people would consider him one what are things you absorbed or observed with Isaac Isaac was in his 70s I was 24 and a half maybe 25 it was one of my first projects it was one of his last ones and we would hang out in his apartment near Lincoln Center and I got to spend time with his wife the thing about Isaac azimov is the character of Isaac azimov was a know-it-all egomaniac for the time today he would be seen as humble but he he published 400 books he invented the modern conception of a robot he wrote seminal work on an enormous number of topics a definitive book about the Bible I mean all over the place but in person he was humble and funny and as a project partner he was completely hands off he spent time with me to make sure I understood the bound Ines of what an Isaac aam project was and then he said go for it and he didn't micromanage a thing because he trusted me and my understanding of where the robots Universe could go and it spoiled me because I thought that was going to happen again and again and again and you know I got Stanley Kaplan into the test prep book business and it took seven years and by the time we the book Stanley was long gone from the project CU he had sold the company but talk about micromanaging with a well-known name so I'm one end of the spectrum was Isaac azimov and on the other end was Stanley Kaplan go figure you know your story about azimov makes me think a little bit of Rick rubben where right out of the gate LL Cool J BC boys he's like oh this is easy this is how it works fantastic what was the project that you're were working with isacon okay so before DVDs lots of people had VCRs and yes I remember a company called Parker Brothers took their board game Clue and they made it into a VCR game and it was Dumb and it sold more than a million copies at $40 wow good for them and so Peter alatka the greatest game designer of his generation and I invented a murder mystery game you could play on your VCR so there was a movie shot with real Union actors in a set in New York City it lasted 38 minutes and took place on another planet about robots and murder and detectives and six times during the short film a screen came up and said hit the pause button and play a card so you would hit pause and you had a stack of six cards and each card had two sides and you would throw a card down and it would be a clue like there are no fingerprints on the gun which might mean it was a robot cuz robots don't have fingerprints right and on the other side of the card it said there were fingerprints on the gun so now you know it's not a robot so it turned out that 2 to the^ of 6 is 150 six or whatever and if you added up the code numbers on the top of each card you played it told you which page in the answer booklet had the answer to that thread through the game so you could play the game hundreds of times and it would be a different outcome each time and we sold the rights to Kodak and cisc and Ebert gave it two thumbs up and advertised it on the Olympics like the full thing it was fascinating wow where were you in your career that that opportunity presented itself or you found that opportunity what had led up to that outside of what you just described so before I did that I had only one real job and my job was at Spiner software we invented educational computer games and I built the first brand of Illustrated computer adventure games I worked with Arthur C Clark and Ray Bradbery and Michael Brighton I got rights to games I worked with Byron price he had a team of programmers and I had a team of programmers we did The Wizard of Oz and I loved it I could still be doing it to this day but the world changed and I was out on my own after a couple years as a book packager but Peter and I knew each other and the momentum from the interactive game thing led me to Isaac's editor and no one had ever asked for the rights the rights weren't expensive and then once I had the rights I found Kodak and Kodak was able to put up the money so we could build this thing and own part of the back end so if I zoom out I have a macro level question for you which has been on my mind a lot if you don't mind which is a question of how you choose next chapters or projects because I'm coming up on the 10th anniversary of the podcast next April so in a few months and figured that would be a good a time as any to pause and reflect on things and think about where I want to go love doing the podcast don't plan on stopping it but there are a lot of Trends driving it towards effectively turning podcasts into fixed location television shows and I don't have much desire to do that y I don't want to be contrarian just for the sake of being contrarian that's its own trap or set of traps but I know you've been very deliberate for instance in choosing not to start a dozen startups and and in favor of choosing to spend your time on other things how do you choose or think about kind of next chapters or how what advice might you give me as I contemplate for what's next type of question you know I think it's very kind of you to say I'm very good at it I don't think I'm good at it but because I'm sort of in public and I do it in a certain way it's noted you know I did five years of a Kimbo it was in the top 1% of all podcasts and then I just stopped and I stopped not because I didn't love it I did love it I stopped because if I kept doing it there's something else I wouldn't do instead and creating a vacuum is required so that I will do the hard work of filling the vacuum but if I just keep doing the thing then there is no vacuum and sometimes the technology changes that's why Spiner went away that's why you couldn't keep making VCR games it's why my Head Start in the cdrom business was worthless cuz CD ROMs went away i' liked in every time I did this being a Pioneer in a New Media space because that's for me the funnest spot and then when the technology changes I got to move on but podcast technology is never going to change I mean you're noting there's a change in the production format and that is a change so in my case what I'm trying to do is not maximize my my income per hour spent nor am I trying to maximize the size of my audience what I'm trying to maximize is are the people I'm serving glad that I did that I showed up to solve an interesting problem and two as I build the stack of things on the bookshelf behind me can I point to them and say that was interesting and generous and I'm glad I did it and you know that's part of a limited attention span theater so it's not for everybody but my whole point of view is that life is projects it is not a job and when you stopped the podcast and created that vacuum did you already have something kind of warming up in the batting cage that was pending that you need to create that vacuum for or did you create the vacuum and then wait for something to get pulled into it not to strain the metaphor but you get the idea no you're not straining it if there's something pending it's not a vacuum there have been times when something so good came along I did it and then how to remove things so I could do it you know when a few of us started squido which was one of the first social networks I had a completely or reorganized my life because we built the 40th biggest website in the US with only eight employees so we were busy this is not what I'm talking about I am talking about an actual uncomfortable vacuum where you feel like you're never going to work again where nothing can possibly be worth what you gave up and that's hard to do yeah it is to do so just to put a put a microscope on that I have as means of backstory done this for periods of time and have found it deeply deeply uncomfortable sometimes fruitful often times not terribly fruitful in part I think because when I create that vacuum I don't know if the best way to embrace the vacuum is to basically just stare at the wall and watch paint dry or to do something else and my mind just kind of folds in on itself you create the VAC and then what do the next few weeks look like in terms of how you spend your time dayto day or week to week I think a fundamental difference between you and me there are so many of them but one of them as I am here talking to what the world Tango Champion former world record holder a long time ago yes is the only thing I have a world record in is being part of the largest co-author book signing in history in which me and 400 other people all signed our book at the same time because I am not a high performer I am interesting and being interesting is really important to me but I am not holding myself to the standard you hold yourself in so many ways and so I could imagine that the thing that gives me Comfort might not make you happy right for sure I agree with all of that and how does that difference translate to what you would do in the weeks following creating the vacuum after say stopping the podcast because I guess you have activities that you're still carrying forward it's not like you're completely idle you're writing still presumably if someone looked at me from the outside I think that they would see that my days aren't that different I am not shipping public work because I don't ship junk but I am internally creating lots of mediocre work and basically creating straw people and saying what would this be like and then what would that be like and here's this thing and I sat with my 60 or 80 watt laser cutter and I cut this thing out what do I think of that and um that invention cycle is joyful but I can't do it forever because I also need the satisfaction of shipping the work and not giving into resistance so what I'm doing when I was a book packager we sold 120 books in 10 years a book a month but I had more than 800 books on my hard drive ready to go not finished but two page five page proposals because the only way to have a finished proposal for me is to have an unfinished one that you didn't ship what is it and this is probably a fundamental question I should have asked earlier but what did you get from writing and having written as consistently as you have and do what is the payoff like why do that okay so the biggest payoff is simple not in terms of equity stock value but in terms of the noise in my head the biggest benefit is I will be writing tomorrow because it's Friday not because I've written the perfect blog post that every single day something gets published by me because I decided that 24 years ago not because I have reconsidered each day whether this one is good enough mhm and even if no one read my blog I would still do it and I'm very fortunate that people give me the benefit of the doubt knowing that I am not guaranteeing this is the best thing I ever wrote and they're still willing to look at it so that's lovely in terms of my professional practice again back to genre having a cure a platform where for a long time if you type blog into Google I was the first match because I just showed up more than just about anybody there's a lot of value to saying this is my lane and you can count on me in this Lane and for someone who is as paretic as I in their creative Pursuits having one of those turned out to be a really useful thing you mentioned a word that I don't recognize but I love the sound of ccure what is that yeah it's a safe haven a niche a place to hide a fortress what a great word yeah all right mental note to use cure well I don't want to take up a ton of time here south this is all incredible incredibly helpful the best part of my day and I know that you're not publishing this as written but I just want to say as for the people who were wondering what's in this magical thing you wrote it includes the line like Patagonian toothfish has become Chilean seab Baths on fashionable menus worldwide right there that's gold Jerry that's just gold and so you need to liberate these things and explain to people what the I know what you're talking about but the fact is that entire species are becoming extinct because somebody figured out a clever way to Market an animal that we eat there's a lot to be said about that one little riff and you have 20 of them in one post thanks man yeah the the no biological freelan it's one of those things things that I've said so many times to friends in conversation and I was finally like you know what if not for any other reason than I am tired of repeating this Gettys Burger dress speech to every Wayward friend who calls me up about to consume really potent drugs I have some of those if you go to Seth stop blog and type advice for authors there are two posts with the same title cuz that's I wasn't being clear that I wrote a year and a half apart and they have each like a dozen or 15 bullet points and now I have a Sig and superum that I can call up if when someone sends me a note a friend or whatever I can say oh I've already thought about this question here you go oh I love it

        "  'transcript': \"if you think there's nothing you can do when disaster strikes think again in Just 4 days I'll build a toolkit for survival my endgame to be ready for anything I'm Tim FIS everything is going up bestseller author and human guinea pig I'll show you how to make the impossible possible by bending the rules pull yourself together I'll find the world's best teachers and push myself to the edge to deconstruct decode and demystify some of the world's toughest challenges in record [Music] time if I can do it so can you this week's experiment ISB Urban Escape why Urban Escape well think about some of my experiments fre gun shooting Brazilian jiujitsu parkour language learning high stakes poker rally car racing the only thing missing for me to become James Bond which has been the point the secret agenda all along is learning how to disappear but it's not all about being a secret agent there are a lot of good reasons to learn practical skills for survival and self-reliance debate what you may but it's really established fact as far as I'm concerned when you look at hundreds of historical examples like Hurricane Katrina hurricane Sandy whatever it might be that desperate times call for desperate measures according to new research the frequency of superstorms and natural disasters is on the rise crime is another reason to hone your self-awareness and self-defense you may want to stop for especially if you spend a lot of time in large cities or traveling overseas preparing for the worst that could happen isn't paranoia it's practical it's cheap insurance against worst case scenarios Tim I'm Kevin Kevin nice to finally meet you Kevin reev is an expert in survival evasion resistance and Escape his school OnPoint tactical is one of the most respected in the country and because he's an expert tracker law enforcement calls on him to solve cold cases what type of learnings and practice do I have to look forward to this week well we're going to try and get your awareness up the main goal is to is to get you to to pay attention to the environment see dangers see opportunities uh we we're going to learn some basic Urban skills such as lockpicking escaping from unlawful custody I'll stress the unlawful part right of course you know police officers don't find it very funny if you hand them back their handcuffs I'd imagine not no to tap into my inner Escape escape artist I'll be following Kevin's lead and learning a broad spectrum of skills how to escape custody lend into my environment lose the tail kick locks and finally jump or boost a getaway car I'll be tested on all of these skills in my final challenge in 4 days our first topic is how to escape unlawful custody M we're going to start off with handcuffs okay the handcuffs that we're going to look at are Smith and West model 100 a little bit of advice always have the keys with you when you practice this good advice so this is the internal workings of a Smith and Western handcuff if you push it you'll notice it goes this way but not this way yep it's like the spikes on a parking garage it won't let you back up this piece right here is called a PW this locking bar actually goes up and down it pivots off this point right here and is pushed down with this spring and you can hear the ratcheting that's this walking bar going up and down if you put a key in and turn it it rotates this way and lifts the Locking bar out of the way so what we're going to do is we're going to use a pick to do the same thing okay and we're going to start with a bobby pin straighten one of these out now I like to use the cuff itself to bend the tool put it into the keyhole here yeah and I put a little Bend in it oh that's perfect so it's very simple all right so you're going in that Notch then M applying pressure and then going applying pressure this way go all the way back over so push it down like that now Rock towards the wrist and it should just pop you did it that's pretty cool what I'm doing essentially is I'm putting the bend in the bar right there uhhuh putting it under tension and then just rocking the bobby pin requires access to the keyhole and fine control you might not have in a real world scenario so Kevin shows me a second option using a Barret using the Barret like a shim you slide it into the Handcuff and underneath the Locking bar this forces the ratchet to temporarily tighten but once the bread is past the teeth it quickly unlocks the hand it's like credit carding a door yeah yeah once I get that in all the way I hold this down and pop that back out this method requires less dexterity so I expect it to be more reliable when I'm tested under stress this is great it is pretty cool isn't it let me talk about flexi [Music] cffs so I'm going to take some paracord in this case I need about 6 feet I'm going to feed it down one of the [Music] sides all right so I get it in there about equal yeah I tie an overhand knot on a bite it's called slip it over my [Music] foot the same thing on this side I see so now now I just lean back and bicycle oh look at that that was pretty quick that's cool that's pretty pretty typical oh paracord I love you let me count the ways number one you can use it to make a bow drill and start a fire number two you can use it to hang your laundry to dry number three you can use it as a friction device to cut through almost anything it's awesome lean back and put that's fast isn't that amazing that's really cool on my first day with Kevin I learned how to break out of restraints but I'll never actually be able to use those skills unless I train realistically Kevin refers often to stress inoculation which means practicing technique under stress being handcuffed and curled up in a dark trunk I think is more of a psychological challenge I can see some people having a very strong negative emotional response to that your reaction time your cognitive function all changes when your heartbeat goes up say 80 100 beats per minute and adrenaline is flooding your system there was a greater risk of losing my tool but panicking doesn't help you so I did a breathing exercise you have to practice in the biochemical state that you're likely to encounter when you need it the only way you do that is by getting comfortable with discomfort outstanding thank you you you're taken to this like a fish to water once I'm feeling good about my ability to Escape Under Pressure it's time to answer a different question how do you lose someone who's pursuing it Kevin says it's vital to blend into what he calls the basine so every neighborhood has has a unique Baseline which means the people in it move at a certain speed as you move through an area you need to look at the Baseline right and learn how to match it you can learn to match the Baseline you become [Music] invisible our minds remember things because there's something about the person that's unusual the whole idea of a of a disguise is to make you blend first category is the homeless people yep the second disguise is what we call an an authority figure so a guy with a mall security uniform big badge on it we don't notice them yeah the third type is what we call the gray man the best disguise of all this is the guy who doesn't leave any stimulus so they're 5'9 to 5'1 check 165 185 lbs check so by being extraordinarily ordinary you have the best chance of being a grey man you could really pull it off once you've made yourself harder to spot it's time to do some Recon and determine if you're still being followed surveillance detection consists of doing a series of activities that don't draw attention to you but that give you the opportunity to check your back Trail so I would buy a newspaper and so what happens when I stop anybody following me has to stop so while I'm buying the newspaper I can just do a quick check on my back Trail kind of memorize who's there Kevin's strategy for detecting a tail is straightforward go about business as usual but Force the person following you to to stop three four or five times while on your way to a destination if the same person keeps showing up it's probably up to no good the idea of surveillance detection is to remove coincidence some people might listen to what Kevin has said about surveillance detection and think that it's paranoid but I have had the experience of being tailed uh now not for information gathering but I was in Cape Town in South Africa and it's very common to have armed robbery in that particular District so I don't undervalue the situational awareness that Kevin is trying to cultivate I think it's extremely important if you've performed surveillance detection and determined that you're still being followed it's time to move on to counter surveillance but there's a lot of things you can do to to counter surveillance right you know I walk down a fight of stairs I turn around and walk back up reversing directions you go in the front door out the back door of a restaurant you see this stuff in the movies all the time some of it actually works what Kevin teaches allows you to to nullify or minimize threats and in so doing you can explore more of your city your country the world in general I've got just one day left to solidify a set of urban survival skills today's escape and evasion menu includes two new offerings breaking and entering so our next topic is lock picking I considered this to be one of the most essential Urban skills this is something I fantasized about learning for decad GES and there's a science to it in its construction a drill bit drills six Chambers into each of these Chambers is placed two pins and on top of that is a spring the purpose of the spring is to put pressure down if you notice there's a break point between all of the pins the key is going to push those pins up so it's going to align the breake points with the shear line and you can rotate the key in lockpicking you have a set and the set has seven or eight picks but there's one if you do an 8020 analysis that really gets the job done 80% of the time and that is the W pick it is also known as a camel back now we're going to put the tension wrench in the tension wrench Works in tandem with the pick the pick mimics the teeth of the key while the tension wrench mimics a key turning action you cycle through three different strokes I'm going to first use the toothbrush which is up and down and back and fourth number two is the rock and roll which is sort of a a seawing motion and then there's the AP Nam porn star which is just this you can understand why so you do a combination of the three and it usually pops the lock there we go there's one thing to take away from it the most common locks are really easy to defeat so I uh came away feeling though I should immediately replace almost all the locks that I have at home that's amazing okay so now I can break out of restraints detect en counter surveillance and pick locks so what's left the getaway vehicle okay so we're at the graveyard of old cars here the junkyard and the reason we're here is because we're going to learn how to defeat the security measures on a car so that you can obtain it for transportation there's two things you have to do you have to be able to defeat the outside lock if it's locked then I have to defeat the ignition right these are what repo guys use a lot and in my practice over the years I discovered that one key is effective on about 80% of the cars and that's this particular key so this is a Jiggler we're going to go to a couple of cars over here and show you how this works I always check all the doors cuz sometimes they're open that's easy so what I'm doing is I'm jiggling up and down yeah I'm twisting and I'm sliding it in and out at the same time wow all right give it a try let me think about this Bingo much easier than you thought that is cool it could take a half a second to a few seconds to defeat the lock get into the car and about the same amount of time to start the car and drive off got it it is astonishingly effective good job man thanks thanks very much those are useful aren't they they are useful using the Jiggler is a non-destructive technique of obtaining Transportation then there are destructive techniques you can use a center punch and you want to actually go for the corners where there's less Flex the window just falls in the other way is using the ceramic casing of a spark plug which feels way too light to do any damage at all and you throw it through the window and the entire thing just implodes CU they feel so light that you wouldn't anticipate they would work better than a lug nut it's normal to see the whole window go in like that once you're in the vehicle it's time to start what if you have no Jiggler well since we're already being destructive you can actually start a car with just a crescent wrench and a screwdriver find something heavy to hit it with first Jam the screwdriver into the ignition and then using the cressent wrench to break all the pins and you're you're creating a permanent fixture that allows you to drive off in the car but the key can never be used again all right good work we have transportation yeah as Kev pointed out you can walk into a junkyard ask what's going into the compactor you could make for a fun weekend activity take the whole family why [Music] not it's day four of my Urban escape and evasion training and time for the final exam welcome to the final challenge CH you've had a couple of days of training I hope you're ready now to put it to work to test my skills Kevin has put together what amounts to a real world kidnapping without giving away the specifics he tells me that I'll have to face five different challenges and it will all end with me getting out of the city all right going to go that direction okay good luck do thank you this is binary if I fail at any one of these pieces I fail the entire challenge [Music] Kevin tells me to wait by the bus stop and get on the next [Applause] bus you may want to stop for simulation or not Kevin's team is extremely realistic they use a real stun gun and hit me multiple times never been hit by a stun gun before and it hurts it sends your adrenaline through the roof which affects your fine motor controls being in the back of a moving vehicle with my hands cuffed behind my back just getting up to your knees is a challenge sometimes people get panicked they're incapable of escaping they get all Twitchy they can't get the pick in the right place it's very common this is where the stress inoculation training saves me it's absolutely critical that I'd already practiced this skill under duress I was very worried about the evasion component of the file challenge because I didn't really have much or any time to [Music] practice I was able to hop across the road as soon as I saw a bus coming to a bus stop excuse me is there any chance I could buy your hat from you for 20 bucks yeah cool boom I have a makeshift disguise I did do some counter surveillance just by looking at say the rack of girly mags and then casually kind of glancing to the left to make sure no one was actually pursuing me to combat the vehicle Pursuit I was going the wrong direction down oneway streets did some other counter surveillance at cafes went through a Starbucks and then out to a back alley and eventually I make my way back to the [Music] warehouse as I get to the final step I'm nervous but I'm also smiling on the inside because 4 days ago I would have written this off as impossibly [Music] difficult [Music] so you completed the challenge did well you completed it in really good time so I would say that was a a definite flying pass hey good job man thank you it's very possible to take what appears to be a complex survival skill and break it down into the essentials identifying which components give you the biggest bang for the buck there it goes it doesn't have to be this kind of spy stuff it could be music it could be language you can find that Archimedes lever that allows you to produce seemingly spectacular results with surprising few hours of practice and that's fun hey guys Tim Ferris here one of the things that kills me about TV is that you have to take all of this amazing footage in our case we had 5 to six days of 12 to 16 hours typically per day and you have to chop it down to 21 or 22 minutes which is a 30-minute show with the ads removed it just makes me want to stab myself in the eyeballs with bicycle spokes it's so agonizing the good news is we have all that footage and so we've taken huge extended scenes we've taken interviews we've taken tutorials everything imaginable that we could get our hands on that we thought was really world class that we wanted to put in and you can find out at 4-Hour Work we.com sltv all spelled out fur Etc and we really feel like we could have made the best 2hour documentary imaginable on the subject that you just saw or had five different shows of equal quality all different with the footage that we captured so please check it out there's some amazing stuff and you can also check out the podcast where I do very long in some cases two to three hour interviews with a lot of the experts in this show and that's the Tim Ferris show which was nominated one of the best of iTunes which I'm very very happy about and uh you can check out both so find everything at 4hourworkweek tocom TV and if you think that's an oxymoron by the way you're right if you want a 4our work week do not work in television thank you for watching\",\n",

        "  'transcript': \"this week I'm going all in nothing gets me learning faster than putting money on the line I am a nervous wreck check out my balls 4 days I've never played a half no experience you're to making me look very foolish here and the world's best teachers this is when my head explodes I'm Tim feris everything going bestselling author and human guinea pig I'll show you how to make the impossible possible by bending the rules together I'll find the world's best teachers and push myself to the edge to deconstruct decode and demystify some of the world's toughest challenges in record [Music] time if I can do it so can you likes action and and gambling this is Las [Music] Vegas this week's experiment is poker for some people it's a game for others it's a science and for some it's a religion for me it's something I've tried to avoid my entire life I have a general phobia of math and I don't like gambling but I want to see if it's possible to take what I perceive as a game of chance and turn it into game of skill at the end of the week I'll go up against three accomplished poker players and I'll hopefully be able to beat at least one hey Tim how are you nice to meet finally to get me up to speed I'll be working with World Poker Tour Champion Phil Gordon who's taken home more than $3 million in tournament prize money and has written best-selling books on how to learn poker I've never played a hand all right well what we're going to basically work on is being a strategic investor I like that phrasing right the point that he made was I can't teach you to be lucky I can teach you however to spot patterns which then determines how you bet look at the games around us right the slot machines the blackjack tables the crabs table that's gambling that's not the way that winning players approach poker winning players have a reason for putting chips into the pot yeah and they know that when they put that $100 in yeah they're going to get more than $100 back out on average he doesn't view it his gambling because he's only investing when he has likelihood of a positive outcome statistically you have to be aggressive and you have to be patient we want to be very selective about the hands that we choose to play but once we choose to play that hand we're going to be very aggressive with it in reality if you play a 100 hands of poker you're going to be folding probably 70 of them and that's difficult for people to do poker is a game of extreme volatility yeah and high variance there are plenty of times that you're going to be 80% to win but that means that 20% of the time you're going to lose so the question isn't did I make money this hand the question is did I make the right decision because there are variables outside of your control any questions for me that will help you craft the approach that we take I'd love to know if you're playing your own money I want you to feel what it's like to have something at risk sure I'll play with my own money then I think it will mean more to you according to Phil the way you'll make decisions the way you'll behave when there's real dollars and cents on the line is very different so once we get to the final challenge I'll be betting $100 of my own money all right starting from zero this is the hand ranking guide every poker hand is comprised of five cards and those five cards determine if you win or lose there are many different types of Poker I'll be playing Texas holdom in which each player receives two cards that only he or she can see and then five additional cards are dealt face up and shared by everyone she bets eight the best five cards out of the seven available to each player comprise their poker hand and the player with the best hand or the best Bluff wins the ranking system is based on probability with the exception of having nothing the most common hands are a pair two pair or three of a kind after that comes a straight which is having five cards in numerical order five cards of the same suit that's a flush a pair plus a three of a kind together makes a full house and four of a kind comes after that finally you have the most valuable hand which is a straight flush and this is when my head explodes let's talk about the structure of a game this is the dealer button Whoever has this is determined to be the dealer when you're sitting at a real table there will be a real dealer but this little dealer button is still important it moves around the table clockwise one person at a time clockwise from the person with the dealer button sits the small blind and then next to that person is the big blind these players provide an an initial bet before receiving their cards essentially it's seeding the pot a little bit and giving you something to play for I see and now there's a round of betting whoever is to the left of the big blind is the first to bet you have basically three options when you're playing at poker table you can fold so you can basically give up you're done you're out you can call which means you match what's on the table or you can raise if all players fold except for one then the round is over otherwise you move on to the first three immunity cards that's called The Flop after that everyone has a chance to bet then the dealer puts out a fourth card called the turn and there's another round of betting then comes the last card the river and you guessed it another chance to bet and so now you're going to make your best five card hand from all seven cards so what are your options right now fold or well you would never fold right now folding doesn't make any sense I feel like my head is 3 ft underwater in details about poker I have a feeling that learning how to play poker in real life will ruin my enjoyment of movie poker the Flop the turn the river minimum bets position on the table that's a lot to cram into 4 days I can't waste any of my hours it's my second day at Caesar's Palace in s City and poker Pro Phil Gordon is cramming my brain with strategy in advance of my first game later tonight basically when you put chips into the pot here's what you should be thinking what are the chances that I've got the best hand right now because that's essentially what we're doing we're putting chips in the pot with the expectation that we have the best hand yeah Phil is teaching me basic principles of hand selection so pre flop do I discard my two cards or do I play them number two understanding positional strength so at a table with multiple players which positions relative to the dealer allow me to be very aggressive and which positions require me to be somewhat defensive so let's say this is the dealer and here are you so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7even eight players left to act behind you so when you're in this seat you're playing out of position and you know the more information you have the better off you are right watch this so small blind big blind fold fold fold fold fold fold now it's just you m and you're going to be in position for the entire hand this is what professional poker players call the office this is where you're going to do all your work you want to be last to act you want few people left that can Rea you and you want to see what they're going to do before you have to put chips into the pot being in a good position provides you with an informational Advantage which allows you to be more selectively aggressive I'll give you a chart that shows you what hands to play from each position and I can show you what the best hands are I think if I want to have a snowballs chance in hell this week I need to focus on what percentage of my hands will be playable at specific positions around the table and I have to get very good at the Art and Science of [Music] intimidation now that I have the fundamentals under my belt Phil decides it's time to throw me into the fire with real opponents 's first hand a poker here we go Jessica raises to seven 10 folds this is very common someone raises and everyone folds you have to balance patience with aggression meaning you wait you wait you fold fold fold fold fold until you know you have a hand worth betting on and then you go for the jugular 10 folds I like that that's suits me finally I find myself in the prime spot at the table with a solid hand make it [Music] six any calls Daniel calls all coming after you coming after me all right in the pop being aggressive doesn't mean only placing bets when you have your best hand in this case I went from having a decent before the Flop to a pretty mediocre hand after the Flop Andy checks Daniel checks but when players in front of you check that often means that they also have weak hands 10 bets 10 if you capitalize on dominant position and get them to fold you can win through intimidation and he holds Daniel FS just won your first pot all right thanks scared to you now yeah hand after hand hour after hour I'm winning a few and losing a lot but playing right next to Phil gives me invaluable coaching there are 1,326 possible starting hands in Texas hold them and on one of my last hands of the night I drop pocket aces this is considered the best starting hand in Texas hold him your first him all right raise the [Music] six that's a goof on my part pocket aces no I shouldn't have gone probably a small little tell here yeah as it turns out my poker face needs some serious work hold yourself Ferris if I hadn't given away my hand I could have pushed the pot size up and taken a lot home the majority of the hands you won today what you had was pre- flop aggression and good position and if you can just keep those things in mind it makes the game so much easier it's already day three my final challenge is tomorrow and I have a few major problems with my game yesterday when I drew a good hand I gave it away right off the bat with a tell also I look at my cards way too often if the Flop comes out and I keep checking my own cards they know that I don't have a pair because that's easy to remember and that is a bad habit ands all right more of the same four-handed no limit hold them yep plugging some of those leaks that we've been working on for the last couple of days right one big change okay I'm going to be playing today fantastic playing next to Phil and having him as an opponent he knows how I will assess certain situations he knows how I will respond in certain situations and that's very intimidating remember don't look at your hand until it's your turn you would not want me to know if you have a good hand or a bad hand right now Phil is an aggressive player he's made 90% of his money identifying the weak players at a table and then picking on them and of course tonight I'm sitting with Phil to my right so that makes me his Target back and forth we go Phil raising and me folding I should keep waiting for a great hand but my impatience is getting the better of me so I play a 73 suited that I'm sure Phil would tell me to fall the tricky thing about bad decisions in poker is that sometimes they pay off I had a whole lot of nothing until the River card and that's when I hit a flush oh [Laughter] checking my pulse not sure that's kosher is oh boy all right hold did make a flush on the river nice even though I got a little lucky with that last hand I've really seen my skills improve a lot since yesterday I'm getting to the point where I can assess the strength of the two cards that I have in my hand I'm doing that and I'm also assessing what the best hands are that my opponents could have Bill's Poker Face is excellent but when he checks it signals to me that he has a mediocre hand then you determine based on all these factors how much you're going to bet bet sizing in this case after the Flop I'm raising about half the size of the pot as a rule so that whether I have a crap hand or a great hand my behavior is the same my opponents can't read me that way okay show them up I've got nothing oh wow that's a top 5% hand when I raise before the Flop you should probably re ra that's a huge hand don't be scared when you have that hand a pair of queens is what Phil would call a hand you bring to war in the future I have to play it that way everyone at the table right now thinks that your R ra is aces kings queens Jacks tens and Ace Kings but you know after you've established a tight image in a game you can get away with pretending like you have it bluffing is important because if they believe you're only betting when you have good hands you're predictable they can immediately fold whenever you bet so occasionally it's worthwhile to bet big when you only have a half decent hand I'm deep in position and betting aggressively the winner and that's exactly what Phil taught me I love it dude he's [Applause] man got him playing Power aggressive poker I love it it's the last day of my poker experiment which means tonight I'll be playing heads up or one-on-one against two pros and one Semi-Pro with my own cash 1500 large on the line fold playing against just one person requires some changes to strategy the goal of heads up is to take all of your opponent's chips so Hand selection also depends on how many chips you and your opponent have in front of you fold you can call there it's close yeah let's try that again the heads up play is really tough for me and my brain feels like an Etch A Sketch fold uh Ras great it's been 4 intense days of Poker training and now it's time for me to head back to Caesar's Palace for my final challenge I've got three heads up matches for you one Semi-Pro and two Pros is not going to be easy but you are well prepared I have $500 of my own money at stake for each of these matches so I could lose as much as $1,500 you got it selective aggression with only 4 days of practice I'm not delusional enough to think that I can beat all three of them match number one the Gimme we'll see but if they're going to take my money good luck I at least hope to make them work for it I am a nervous wreck but I'm just going going to follow my game plan I'm not going to try to deviate I'm not going to improvise I'm not going to get cute once again that means a lot of folding as soon as the Flop comes down that's where skill and experience will kick my ass my job therefore is to make it really expensive for them to see the Flop I have to wait for the blinds to get bigger which in this tournament happens every 10 minutes that's when I can shift to aggressive short stack strategy and go all in before the Flop which will give me better odds of winning [Music] he's all [Music] in seeing some aggression right there when I went all in and saw Tai's eyes pop open then I knew I had a Fighting Chance because it really threw him off nice play sir all in just continued to pound and pound and pound and pound soon Phil's strategy starts to pay off he's all in and with a lucky Ace draw I beat Ty King and claim victory well played sir well played that first win really gave me a tremendous amount of confidence in Phil and his system but I'm going to need a hell of a lot more than confidence to beat Sarah who's won hundreds of thousands of dollars playing poker raised the 400 Sarah's really intense she does not talk much and I found that unnerving she just kind of and looked down at cards for a fraction of a second then make her decision raise the 400 I found myself going a little crazy in my own head with internal dialogue because there's no external dialogue I keep getting crap hand after crap hand and whenever I nail an ace or a king Sarah folds but luckily the blinds go up and Sarah puts it all on the line raise all [Music] in turn them up please I show Jack nine and coincidentally she shows Jack eight nice hand the Flop comes down giving both of us a pair of Threes then on the turn we each get a two pair with Jack's High then the river comes out wow giving me a pair of nines and the game good game I never in my wildest dreams expected to beat Sarah two out of three that's ridiculous three out of three seems overly ambitious but it won't stop me from trying raise the 400 according to Phil Anders is the most dominant of the three players that I'll face today he's razor sharp and he has a lot of experience in the first few rounds a couple of Lucky a draws give me a slight lead in ship count but then on the eighth hand he makes a big move now 3,300 total end up making me look very foolish here the turn comes out and it's a seven of clubs if Anders has an ace in his hand that pair will beat mine if he has two clubs that'll also mean a dangerous flush all in balls it something about the way he's been betting and his muted reactions to my raises gives me a little more confidence in my Jack pair so I go for the kill oh good hand good hand thankfully he's only got a pair of sevens but the river still hasn't landed and there are 11 cards in the deck that can help him win win those are called outs any club n or sth will give him my $500 taught you well I won and I couldn't believe I won and then I saw Phil jump up and down I was like oh I won this thing you got to be kidding me awesome awesome awesome job that is awesome that's a hell of The Last Hand yeah wow 3 and 0 that's amazing and 1,500 bucks I think the moral of the story is Sir trust in a system it's a game of incomplete information and you can use a system with basic guidelines very basic mathematics you've just won three matches in a row against three of the best players in poker that was a good him I'm no longer easy money and all I had to do is follow the recipe selective aggression right that's it name of the game Let's selectively go get a drink let's selectively go get a drink and you're buying oh I'm buying all right I'm buying hey guys Tim Ferris here one of the things that kills me about TV is that you have to take all of this amazing footage in our case we had 5 to six days of 12 to 16 hours typically per day and you have to chop it down to 21 or 22 minutes which is a 30-minute show with the ads removed it just makes me want to stab myself in the eyeballs with bicycle spokes it's so agonizing the good news is we have all that footage and so we've taken huge extended scenes we've taken interviews we've taken tutorials everything imaginable that we could get our hands on that we thought was really world class that we wanted to put in and you can find it at 4hourworkweek tocom TV all spelled out fur Etc and we really feel like we could have made the best 2hour documentary imaginable on the subject that you just saw or had five different shows of equal quality all different with the footage that we captured so please check it out there's some amazing stuff and you can also check out the podcast where I do very long in some cases two to three hour interviews with a lot of the experts in this show and that's the Tim Ferris show which was nominated one of the best of iTunes which I'm very very happy about and uh you can check out both so find everything at 4hourworkweek tocom and if you think that's an oxymoron by the way you're right if you want a 4our work week do not work in television thank you for watching\",\n",

        "  'transcript': \"[Music] sometimes to learn fast you have to slow way down the only thing that there is is the now that's the most honest way to be 4 days one badass Legend you think you have it paddle again and some seriously unpredictable terrain come on turn catch a wave go Tim here we go I'm Tim Ferris everything going up best selling author and human guinea pig I'll show you how to make the impossible possible by bending the rules together I'll find the world's best teachers and push myself to the edge to deconstruct decode and demystify some of the world's toughest challenges in record time SP if I can do it so can you this week's experiment is surfing I've always been afraid of Surfing I grew up on Long Island right on the water never learned how to do it because I was afraid of drowning I had lung issues swimming issues but all of my friends who do it say it's changed their lives it's a spiritual experience and I want to get a taste of that firsthand so where better to do that than in Kawai Surfer culture is very protective because are dealing with a limited resource nowhere is this more true than on kawhai where they have an eden-like island they have a very fragile ecosystem so they've asked us not to mention any specific beaches so I'm not going to tell you the name of this beach on kawai's Northern Shore but I can tell you who I'm here to meet Le Hamilton is a living Legend he's widely considered the Undisputed king of big wave Greg null who's a Pioneer himself said that he's the best the Earth has ever seen lar is also an unbelievable physical specimen the guy is a mutant he is almost 50 years old yet he trains alongside NBA Allstars and he can outrun them out jump them outlift them and certainly out serf them the guy's a monster and he's also an innovator you've seen standup paddle boards well guess who popularized it that's right lared Hamilton you know the whole thing about the ocean it's more powerful than you are and so in a way you want the ocean to work for you you don't want to work for the ocean and you don't want to try to work against the ocean people go you conquered the wave you don't conquer a wave the wave allows you to ride it and you survive it waves are moving energy wind energy formed out at Sea rolls through the water in a circular motion creating waves in shallow water waves slow down and begin to pile up they increase in height Crest at the surf zone and finally collapse typically a wave is measured on its face from trough to Crest as a rule of thumb if it's 20 ft or higher it's considered a big wave some waves are so big and fast that you need a jet ski to catch them lired has surfed waves that Tower more than 60 ft High the official world record for largest waves served is 78 ft but I'll start out on waves that are more like the bunny slopes normally beginners learn to surf by taking a quick lesson on the beach then trying to pop up on actual waves they expend a ton of effort paddling and often burn out before they can Master even the basics since I have just 4 days to learn to surf over paddling could very well be my downfall to avoid this lar has created a progressive training approach we'll start by exploring wave Dynamics and hopefully how to relax when the ocean punishes you next we'll work on board balance and control and then progress finally to prone surfing technique and how to catch waves at the end of the 4 days I'll complete an undisclosed challenge of L's choice you know body surfing is the most intimate form of Surfing we always say that your body is the first board that you own right you know being a gymnast you want to learn how to land first right not how to flip first cuz you'll flip and then you don't know how to land learn about wiping out and then go learn how to surf and then when you wipe out you'll be like oh yeah no problem I won't Panic exactly the location that lar chose for body surfing is a very dangerous location a lot of drownings here he grew up nearby and every other time he went out he would see tourists or novices get swept out to sea and this location is to be my introduction to body surfing is there any sort of textbook understanding I should have there's a there's a thing about what goes out must come back now you can use that to your advantage if you want to go out you go under and you get brought back out and if you want to come in you don't come in under you come in on top because then the energy pushes you in so you don't fight it at this particular corner of the beach you have fresh water coming down from the mountain colliding directly with the salt water it presents very gnarly vortices and forces which is exactly what lared wanted me to experience firsthand so that I could get tumbled so that I could get uncomfortable and learn to get comfortable with that discomfort I've always thought of body surfing as having both arms out Superman style barreling straight into Shore but lared rides with The Brak on his side giving him more Edge and allowing him to ride across the wave you would be going left yeah and that's a left and you'd be going right and that's a right yeah I got inside two very small tubes yeah which was a cool experience and I'm just feeling my heart incredible well the amount of of power that the water you can feel the the grip that the water get to you and that's where people freak out an effective way to overcome your fears is to Simply expose yourself to the worst case scenario and this is why lared brought me body [Music] surfing in this chaos I ask myself in the words of senica is this the condition that I so feared and ultimately it wasn't nearly as bad as I'd imagined in my head while respect for the ocean can help you fear of the ocean simply handicaps you got a little hickey from the ocean it's a good start this morning's body surfing lesson gave me a feel for powerful ocean currents and how to best roll with the waves now it's time to add a board to the equation I got you one real nice and stable I appreciate that stable but instead of going straight to surfing we'll start with standup paddle boarding and I'll give you a quick little pointer so everybody always tries to get stable first before they start moving get moving and then you'll be stable [Music] interesting lar makes it look incredibly easy yeah you can switch again switch sides unfortunately Ely for us mere mortals walking on water is tougher than you [Music] think you looking at your board doesn't make your balance better the head has to be up everything's all about spinal alignment and don't react to something that hasn't happened yet cuz that's what happens you see the thing coming and you go like that and then all a said you're reacting to your reaction and not the obstacle it it doesn't and sometimes it doesn't even affect you in short I need to stop getting ahead of myself and trying to prepare for what may or may not happen it's time to feel more and think less there you go there you go nice nice catch it yeah catch it when you think you have it paddle again better to paddle when you've already gotten it when you think you have it take an extra paddle and that's true with prone yeah squaring up to the wave matching power with power you know I always tell people paddle like you want it I finally make some Headway on the standup paddle board so L's graduating me to prone surfing Tim this is Kay for my day-to-day surfing practice I'll be working with Kay Alexander he's fourth generation kawaiian he's also very well known on the pro circuit for being extremely strong and very very stylish watching a pro CER catch a wave makes it seem effortless but it requires technical prowess an intuitive feel for the ocean masterful balance and the ability to read waves it engages all the senses what are the most common mistakes that you see from novices sometimes people try get to here and then they'll try and get up it's like a David bla trick yeah grab the board until you're comfortable and get up perfect how far apart would you like your legs this is kind of the style thing like once you get good you're like oh cool and then this is kind of not being too cool you know a little more than uh shoulder width yeah go left now go left just a little twist I'm going left now go right that's good perfect like that you got it you're going to be a natural poke it through come on okay now get on the challeng is my first time surfing were manyfold number one my paddling motion was way too large and noisy that was really kind of windmilling don't you don't want to reach too far yeah right about here you know your arms still nice and bent very short sort of water polo type swimming motion when we're paddling every once in a while you know you look back a little you know okay lay down look at the ring secondly I wasn't paddling enough so I would paddle paddle paddle to try to catch a wave and then I would stop just short good effort in the process of paddling for a wave it's also very important as novice that you maintain your board in a perpendicular position to the shore I had a lot of trouble with this because I would pull really hard with my left hand and it would push the nose of the board right that caused all sorts of [Music] problems once I finally popped up on a long board you don't need to pump your legs to keep going going that's something that I'd seen Short board Riders doing in competition so I tried to use it and he said look walk further up on the board you don't pump it it makes you look like a poser Slow Down Slow Down Speed Up scoot up now yep perfect K is an outstanding teacher and he understands how to layer in skills and also practice in tandem the side by-side comparison allowed me to not only hear what he was saying but to emulate his Tech but he was by my side the entire time than you sir tomorrow we'll up the ante and head to a new beach to tackle more difficult [Music] waves it's day three and I'm not sleeping in the surf conditions are just right so we get up at dawn I'm not much of a morning person but you have to always be on call like a fireman if you're not there when the waves are there you ain't going surfing you're going to be swimming down walk out a little session itself was frustration upon frustration I'm falling to the left falling to the right and then repeating that ad nauseum good effort let's get ready to catch this finally two amazing things happen number one I actually turned I got up and I was able to turn for the first time that is an incredible feeling it reminded me a bit of snowboarding but it was much more Sublime there you go t good job secondly as a reminder of why so many people find surfing incredible the interaction with nature came to a head oh a turtle a little more ight there's turtle turtle and enormous sea turtle directly in front of us popped its head out looked right at me and then I turned around and he goes oh look whale literally 5 seconds later and a whale breached and then there was a double rainbow above us I mean if ID put it into a novel my editor would have been like too much Ferris too much dial it back it was amazing to help us navigate this beautiful and unpredictable ocean Wilderness we found an experienced team of watermen who are working behind the scenes Titus kinimaka is managing water safety for our crew and Manning the jet ski Uncle Titus as he's known to the locals is also a songwriter and a beautiful [Music] musician he's direct descendant of King Kamehameha he's a respected Elder he's also one of the first Pros out of Kawai as a surfer and he's dedicated his life to protecting the fragile ecosystem of kawhai you can learn how to surf you as as as quickly as you can but to learn how to read the waves and read the water it takes years to learn that yeah during a lull on the waves I get the inside scoop on what it's like to live and breathe the ocean I think the sensation of Surfing sometimes is where there's no time yeah and there's no end and no beginning it's just a continuation and so that's why you wake up at 5:00 in the morning that's why you every time there's a swell you're looking because you want to go back to that place where there is no time and really the only thing that there is is the now so in a way that's the most honest way to be and there's nothing nothing past nothing future just then it's a lot of a lifetime program it's not just a seasonal thing you know it's lifetime it's the only activity that I know of where I have friends who are not professional athletes who have ch reorganized their entire lives around that one activity for sure part of it is is your relationship with the ocean yeah and that everything's from the ocean and that we're made of ocean and I think it does chemical things to your body your pH balance and that stuff the entire conversation was really just a rumination of the various approaches and philosophies of two masters not only Masters but people that I aspire to be like because both of them view age as just an excuse it is an excuse that people use to dodge the things that they want to do that for me was hugely inspiring and if you keep surfing you're going to develop your own style you know I want I really want to the point where you'll have your own style well there's your wave right there the waves are picking up and it's time to ride P that way my still unknown final challenge with L is tomorrow so Kay is pushing hard come on come on harder harder harder I just like trying to stress him out hey hurry up stop turn go test him you know this is the last afternoon to work on my two biggest problem areas position and wave selection that was really good so for the first part positioning Kay taught me to start on the beach identify where I want to be and then look back and identify a land marker so that when you get out on the water you can line yourself up with that secondly for wave selection there's a lot of subtlety involved but waiting for a set let's just say of three waves he would encourage me as a novice to go for the second or ideally the third so that if I screw up I don't get pummeled by two or three waves and get get tumbled to the point that I get extremely fatigued I'm like a proud father you know he's a a teacher's dream you know you tell him not to do something listens and doesn't do it tell him to do something he listens and does it okay lay down buddy come on yeah let's try p was incredible to actually ride this terrain which is changing every second and get a really nice ride out of it where you're feeling your body in the board and everything respond to this intrinsic Force it's a beautiful thing I can definitely see why people get hooked when the Moment of Truth finally arrived I asked lar what's the objective what's the goal what's the challenge and he turned it into an anti- challenge you know what your goal is today have [Music] fun it took me a while to grasp that as a very goal oriented OCD type personality why bother surfing if it's not fun you know we always say the person that that is the best is the one that's having the most fun remember to breathe this laid-back approach makes it much easier to incorporate L's instruction and take my surfing to the next level I want you to try to go he recommends using a butterfly stroke to paddle for the last say three or four strokes to catch a wave which would keep me more more aligned here we go P PD P [Music] pad that one's going to kill him lared also gives me a good pointer on how to improve my balance L was saying look you might feel silly doing it in smaller waves but get used to like really sticking your arms out so you can kind of tight RPP walk and correct your balance as needed when lar and his buddies invented foil boarding they discovered that spreading your fingers improves performance something about that opening of the fingertips connected with the neur like the neurological thing to Flying if birds fly they look pretty but it's also a functional thing it's not just oh it looks good it actually is for a [Music] purpose I think Tim's challenges will be just to be able to generate the endurance to be able to paddle for you know longer periods of time in order to catch waves and get out of the way and get back out until I build up my endurance L suggests a trick for increasing momentum using my leg kick almost like a Jane Fonda workout to help Propel me slightly more forward I liken it to Arms with running all of those things combined uh allowed me to catch a bunch of waves today nice go k go yep oh yeah Ah that's it no more lesson that's pretty cool I'm kind of impressed man I'm impressed some people take him a year just to learn how to not go straight exactly if lar does have a hidden challenge for me today it's seeing if I can be self-sufficient so that I can go surf at home in San Francisco or anywhere in the world he goes up on shore to watch me attempt to choose and catch my own wave for the first time I'm projecting catch a wave catch a wave catch a wave go Tim here we go here we go go battle battle battle Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah stand up nice nice good [Music] job I'd heard lared interviewed before where he said the goal is to feel supremely alive in this one week of surfing now I realize a day of Surfing no matter how bad is better than a day in the office and that was the point of the exercise I performed better than I had all week why because I was just trying to have funy nice work so so much [Music] fun hey guys Tim Ferris here one of the things that kills me about TV is that you have to take all of this amazing footage in our case we had 5 to 6 days of 12 to 16 hours typically per day and you have to chop it down to 21 or 22 minutes which is a 30-minute show with the ads removed it just makes me want to stab myself in the eyeballs with bicycle spokes it's so agonizing the good news is we have all that footage and so we've taken huge extended scenes we've taken interviews taken tutorials everything imaginable that we could get our hands on that we thought was really world class that we wanted to put in and you can find it at 4hourworkweek domcom all spelled out fur Etc and we really feel like we could have made the best 2hour documentary imaginable on the subject that you just saw or had five different shows of equal quality all different with the footage that we captured so please check it out there's some amazing stuff and you can also check out the podcast where I do very very long in some cases 2 to three hour interviews with a lot of the experts in this show and that's the Tim Ferris show which was nominated one of the best of iTunes which I'm very very happy about and uh you can check out both so find everything at 4hourworkweek domcom TV and if you think that's an oxymoron by the way you're right if you want 4-Hour Work Week do not work in television thank you for watching\",\n",

        "  'transcript': \"my number one bucket list thing in life is to write a book and no one was stopping me but myself but for 20 years I couldn't do it and honestly like all I had to do was write a little bit every day and I would write a book that's all I ever wanted and so how can you get in the way of yourself that consistently and we all do it as writers and once I unlocked the ability to write my fear was ever turning that switch back off and that's where I think the daily habit is critical like I wrote today before I came here and it's Saturday mhm and I'll write on a on the plane and I'll write in the back of an Uber I'll do whatever it takes to get some words in that [Music] day you so great to see you good to see you man yeah I'm glad we were able to do this in person and I wanted to say up I like to think of myself as being pretty unorthodox in my creative process and Publishing but you are the person in the last year or two who I've called the most for advice and I've wanted to take out to lunch to ask questions because you've had such a wild journey man on multiple levels you're like who can think crazier than me yeah I don't is this is a good thing I guess oh it's great it's a great thing we're not going to get to some of the crazy we're not going to get to the sing Adventures although I'll probably tease that in the intro but we are going to talk about creative process I thought I would start with something that I have a vague recollection of we were walking in the woods together talking about this and it was how you structured and we're going to bounce around chronologically but how you structured the end of wool and I want to say it was related to a bit of creative slight of hand taking readers through yeah emotions and could you just walk us through not necessarily giving too many spoilers for people who haven't read the book but I could do it vaguely I think vaguely yeah what did you do there what was the artistic decision there and the practical decision most of what I've figured out as a writer I've learned as a reader like there's things that tickle me and this actually and this happened before what I'm going to talk about sounds a lot like the Marvel teasers after the credits this was before any of that but I had the same gut feeling that there are some things that you don't want to just turn the page and get hit with that you really need to ask the reader to step away have some emotional response maybe even get upset at me as as the author MH and then after that pause have that little extra nugget that they've been waiting for you want to make them feel like you're not going to get what what you want out of this when they think the story runs to credits yeah so I was trying to figure out what could I put at the end of the story that's not part of the story it needs to be you know acknowledgements like thanks to my family and what not it needs to make it feel like the book is over and what I came up with was an interview a series of questions and answers and of course I'm writing the questions as well right with you this is a Q&A with the author yeah and I think the last question and answer is did you write all these questions yourself and the last answer is yes so I'm very upfront about it but it's the first time after spending 500 pages with me that you're spending time with me in my own voice and I think the thing that I I I didn't mean for it to work this well but I was intentional about asking for this one of the things one of the questions was hey I love this book how can I help other people discover it and share the word and I and the answer was tell everyone you know about it write reviews go go on Amazon and write reviews share it on Facebook and that year I think because so what happens you finish this book you're happy it's a good book M but there's a little thing that's upsetting you you read this Q&A and you're like okay it's try to be mad at this guy he's pretty funny and then right after you're not mad at me anymore I give you the thing you really want deep down after that and it's up to you to find it and not everyone does and this is this is after the interview after the interview and I think the last thing they remember in this roller coaster of emotions like they hate me oh this guy's not too bad oh my gosh that's exactly what I wanted I love this guy oh he asked me to write a review I'm going to go do that right now and so it worked in a way that I didn't anticipate it worked so well that the year that wool came out it was the most reviewed and highest reviewed item on Amazon which I didn't find out about until I was at a a conference with some Amazon people and someone on stage mentioned that without knowing that I was in the audience and I was like I it was news to me I was like is this a real thing great way to get the news yeah and it was really cool but it was because I was trying to engineer what would have tick on me as a reader mhm and thinking about that emotional roller coaster and not being beholden because when I published the book traditionally Publishers were not up for this they were like no we don't we don't yeah and you had to follow the formula but in my case breaking that formula really worked to my advantage all right so you you have wool and your Silo Trilogy was later dab by Apple TV becoming the number one drama of all time so I think some people might have an inkling of of this piece of work my understanding is that you effectively committed to writing in obscurity for 10 years to see what would happen what did your writing career so to speak look like prior to wool I was writing an obscurity but I you know it's it's amazing my first book did better than a lot of first books of out with a very small press I ended up buying the rights back to it in order to self-publish the sequel and then self-publish the first book as well and within a year of of writing I was making a couple hundred doar a month off my writing which might sound like really small but that puts you already in what you know top top 1% yeah it's ins say how little writers make and I knew that going in because I worked at a bookstore and so I was spending time with a lot of writers so I had low expect expectations going in I told myself I would write two books a year for 10 years and then after 20 books I would know if I had what it took to be a writer and basically it lets you just get out of your own head you don't Market that first book you don't wonder why success hasn't happened to you you just work on getting better producing content because what I'd seen as a book seller is that these writers who broke out who had three or four books buying them like Dan Brown when Dan Brown broke out he already had a few books out that weren't that huge the same with George George R Martin and that back list takes off so it's almost like you instant published you know six books at once right right so publish the prequels but they are actually prequels there but it's beneficial for not your first thing to take off because I'll tell you it's much harder to write once you've had some success because you have other demands on your time you have many more people watching and syndrome totally all that stuff gets in the way I hate giving this advice to writers cu no one wants to hear this yeah but the time that you just get to write because you love to create you're just trying to write one or two books a year you're not thinking about sales is the best time you'll ever have as a writer it might not be your best time as a professional or a human right financially but your best time as a writer is when you're doing it for yourself and no one's looking over your shoulder while you're doing it why did you make that decision so there's the decision you made but I'm interested in the thought process behind it because you're very deliberate in my experience I mean you're also very eager to to grasp Serendipity and so on but like you're a thoughtful guy so why commit to 10 years of doing that what did you get from writing or what did you hope to get from being a writer I hoped to put books out that weren't already there I think when I was 12 or 13 years old I read my first works of Science Fiction I think it was uh hitchhiker's guy to the Galaxy and Enders Game I read them back to back and I'd never read books like this before there aren't many books like this two books a lot of people rate them you know in in their top 10 and I just wanted more of that and I and I wanted more newness like things that just tickled me and it's hard to find that like again something I learned as a book seller is there's all these books on the bookshelves but for any reader who walked in there were very few that were actually going to blow them away and so I want wanted to feel some of that void my first attempt to write was right after I read those books and was basically terrible fanfiction like hitchiker Guide to the Galaxy fanfiction and yeah I was trying to to fill this space that I thought was on the bookshelf which is why to this day when I write something if I feel like it's similar to anything else I'm not interested I do the same thing in the non-fiction world for sure it's like I'll will only write if I can't find it if I'm if I try to find it I don't want to do it a lot of heavy lifting I give away my ideas all the time if I think of an invention that I think will make a lot of money I just try to convince someone else to make it because I just want to own it I don't actually want to like Kevin Kelly same thing same great great about that so you mentioned something in passing I want to come back to which is buying back the rights to that first book in order to write the sequel but also to self-publish the first book why did you do that and what was the language that you used because if the first one was more successful than you anticipated did that mean the publisher wanted to hold on to it how did that actually happen as far as conversation or negotiation yeah I got really lucky there I was going to give my first book away I was going to publish it on my blog like a chapter at a time and just use it to get feedback on my writing while I worked on more stuff I was already sending the word document to anyone who wanted to read it like strangers on forums you know people who worried about piracy and protecting their stuff I was like emailing this to every cousin I had all my family members cuz what you realize is like yeah you spent so much time energy making this thing you love convincing even a loved one to take the eight hours it might take to read it is a huge ask most people won't do it and you're expecting people to pay you for the pleasure like you I was like okay I'm about to pay like my my sister $20 to read this that's how this was going to go transactionally so I was going to give it away people who were reading it were like you should get this published it's great and everyone's dream was to get a publisher and so I was absorbing that dream secondhand even though it really wasn't necessarily my dream my dream was just to get people who wanted to read this to read it not even force people to read it but just anybody who thought this would be a fun story here it is and the day that I signed the contract to sign my rights over to that publisher was one of the worst days of my life and it was everyone else's dream how did they find you or vice versa I was quering agents I was doing everything okay so you like you like okay I've absorbed this secondhand smoke SL stream of getting a publisher how do we do this yeah going to the library reading books on querying how to write a query letter here's the book of agents this is like I remember that there wasn't a lot of online resources like there are now now there's apps to help you keep up with who you've queried and the responses and all this stuff so I'm figuring this out but I'm also like signing up for Twitter as soon as Twitter launches I'm I have a Blog on blog spot this is like way you know back in the day and on twit T I created a Twitter account under my character's name I'm tweeting as her which led to a lot of confusion in emails people were emailing me as Molly which is like my character's name and two small presses saw my blog post and my Twitter feed and asked for a a partial read and both asked for a full read after reading the partial and then both made offers and so I kind of circumvented the agent route and at this point they were just they were paying me money which it was like not even in the tens of thousands it was in the thousands but they were going to do all the editing cover art all the production cost I wasn't going to have to spend a penny to publish my book which was already better than I thought so my my ambitions were so low that I thought this was a huge win MH but then the night we went out to dinner me and my my ex-girlfriend and decided you know sign this contract to celebrate it I felt sick to my stomach so your system my system had a different take my gut knew here were these characters that was already hip deep in the sequel I was planning on writing you know at least a Trilogy with these characters and I was given the the IP away yeah you know I was giv the rights away and what I was giving it away for I was like wait I would spend that am amount of money to own this for the rest of my life and I I'll never forget that sensation and ever since then I've never done a deal where I'm giving away rights for my lifetime like even major deals with big Publishers as far as my agent I know we're the only ones in the industry who get these so this this is something can you say a little bit more about this because this is something I think for any author or even wouldbe author who's listening if they've done their homework it's something they will find shocking yeah I still find it shocking it's crazy so when we went around to the big Publishers wool was already a New York Times bestseller we had Ridley Scott on board and 20th Century Fox to a feature so it had it it was making a lot of money selling a lot of copies crowding out books in the bestseller list from the major Publishers and so people were offering seven figures Plus for this for the rights and I was showing them my monthly sales and saying you know you you can't compete with what I'm already doing which was a power IM balance they never really and just for the sake of clarity this was self-published this was all self-published and I had an agent at this time Kristen Nelson the best in the industry who was so cool because she was like I'm not sure you should do a deal with a publisher which leaves her out of the money too right it's not her incentive to say that but her incentive was she wanted to have these conversations with Publishers to help her other clients she was like the deal that I want to get you will never get because it's too soon she told me that early on but we need to start having these conversations so a future author can get this deal and what we didn't know is that it would change quick enough that we would get that deal and so we were turning down these huge offers from Publishers until and we just told like we want to do a printon deal with a time limit and I get to keep all the digital rights all the audio the rest of the world but you publish it the print only as if it's a major book book tours Major Distribution all that and finally Simon Shuster said we rather make some money than no money and of the big five they're kind of the smallest most Nimble so I want to underscore something you said for for people who may not be in the industry the term limit yeah the term limit is the best okay so for most authors who do a book deal number one it's all rights and it's usually world rights so it's worldwide and it's all formats every format even formats that aren't invented yet in effect you're handing over the copyright and you're like okay this is yours it's for the rest of your life and then like another 30 years after your death like that yeah but you did not do that so what was the time limit and what happened at the sort of XPR of that that period of time we did a fiveyear printon deal and so after five years we knew the date we'd get the rights back a lot of other books you can might get your rights back because it stops selling it goes out of print but now that there's print on demand and ebooks it's easy to keep a book in print just to keep the rights y the book was still a bestseller when we got the rights back and so we got to go to auction again and this is where you believe in your work more than a publisher does like they didn't I guess s Scher was like look we'll make some money for a year this fat will go away and in in 5 years we won't be sad to lose it and and 5 years later we got to go to auction with all the big Publishers and we'll get to do it again while the TV show is probably still airing which will be a really unique situation to be in so you get multiple bites of the Apple I mean financially speaking right because you get to resell the IP or the individual book every 5 years yeah I get to lease it to Publishers and the good thing is I'm hoping I don't get a tempting enough offer next time because I'm dying to self publish again like I I love knowing what's coming in every month doing price promotions I love being able to put a new cover on or you know create new interior content like it's fun to just give new life to the to the additions what would you say to people listening who think to themselves I think rightly so just based on what we've said so far well look he had a tiger by the tail or a dragon by the tail with wool he had Ridley Scott he had all these offers so he had incredible leverage that I will never have so the idea of having a time limit is just it is tantalizing but Out Of Reach For People unless they have a situation like Q what would you say to them I thought that about myself as well so I get that but what's amazing is that a lot of bigname authors who entire publishing houses structure around also don't ask for it and they could do it you're the only person I know who has this and I know a lot of and you know a lot of very very very big authors yeah and I think there's a bit of a Stockholm syndrome with Publishers and and authors and I love my Publishers I've Loved all my Publishers I worked with even the ones who like didn't do a great job I still love working with them cuz they're book people and I love book people but I've always felt like we were in it together like we we helped each other get lucky they didn't do everything for me and I didn't do everything for them but I think some authors feel like without that publisher they wouldn't have had the break they wouldn't have had the career they've had like they're relationship has always been with the publisher first my relationship was with Readers first and so that's my bedrock the readers and myself were in it together and Publishers have can come in and play around but I don't feel like I need to make stupid business decisions just to thank them for our past relationship but I think a lot of other authors are in that but to the people starting out that you're asking about I think you have to have confidence in your work mhm you have to write a book that you think one other human will find this the best book they've ever read it'll be their favorite book not because it's objectively better than other books but because it finds the right the right a audience most writers I know have this they feel two things at once they feel like my work is terrible I'm an imposter I shouldn't publish this there's so many mistakes in it but deep down they also think this is going to find the right person they're going to love it and and I would say when you're trying to believe in yourself to listen to that voice and make business decisions based on that voice make your creative decisions based on the impostor syndrome because that'll make you be a better writer but listen to that part of you that thinks this might be amazing m and protect your work with that voice in mind you also mentioned something that I think will stick out to a lot of folks who have published or who are hoping to publish and that is that you hit the New York Times list with the self Pub book a lot of folks would assume that is not possible if they've tried to do their homework or maybe they've even been told by Publishers that it's not possible and there are some counter examples sometimes they're imprints but then we get into a bit of a gray area right they're like smaller basically publishing houses within a publishing house and it's not quite what we would consider self-pub let's say how does that work like how do you get the distribution to count because the New York time list specifically is kind of a black box yeah right on some level editor Choice list there is input from neelon book scan and stuff but certainly when I was shopping my first book I mocked up a cover and I threw a ISBN like UPC code on the fake cover which I just grabbed as clipart or some type of you know Google searches result and they were like is this self-published because if so we're not going to touch it yeah and I would love to hear you just explain how you actually hit the New York Times list with a self pup book it's changed over time other people have done it there's been times where quite a few self-published books will be in the on the bestseller list but it is a curated list someone I might get some of these details wrong but someone did a an analysis of New York Times contrib contributors and found that their books were higher on the list that made sense in any other statistical way yeah one one of the weeks that I hit the list with wool I know what I sold that week and I know what the number one author who's a friend of mine sold the week before and I I think I hit the list at like three or five and it was just the New York Times not wanting me to be number one yeah cuz my sales were like 3x what so it's not based on sales yeah it's based on a handful of independent book stores around the country that are called reporting stores y they do take Amazon into account but they have a like fractional multiplier yeah to Discount the sales CU those aren't real book sales those aren't real book readers all that stuff so there's all these weird biases that go into it I think I hit it because I got lucky that week that the people who The Gatekeepers just weren't paying attention they saw something number one on Amazon and they gave it but you had retail distribution I had retail distribution but it was through create space at the time which is what Amazon's print on demand I think it was called so if a bookstore wanted it they would have to go out of the way to buy it through like Ingram like an expanded distributor there wasn't a sales rep from a Publishing House coming with a catalog and saying we believe in this book which is how most books are sold or purchased by bookstores in both so it was the power of the reader was like too big to ignore cuz at the time I think I was selling you know 50,000 or so copies a month on the low end month after month that's a lot of lot it's a lot yeah and for it to do it and there were times where it was double and triple that for a single month and you can't ignore it when it happens that big but I also say you don't have to set out to to do this to type of successful career I was super happy how many books had you completed prior to wool I'd written five novels and another novelet this thing that's like shorter than a noela and then wool came out that was like my seventh publish thing and it was also in that novelet range like 50 pages okay and what was it I'm sure you've had this question a lot but I've never asked it so here we go yeah what made it different like why do you think it captured people in the way that it did struck that chord I think I was very lucky that I was started to publish at a time when e-readers and print on demand were around it's a short piece you can read in a lunch break it's hard to recommend a book you don't finish and it's hard to review a book you don't finish unless you're writing a really bad onear review one thing that helped with word of mouth is that I was writing something that people could get through and honestly that once you start it's hard to put down it's hard not to finish that really helped it super affordable I was charging 99 Cents for the ebook and the the little paperback which I think only like several hundred maybe got purchased before the cover changed was like $4.99 those little paperbacks now go for like $1,000 and I I wish I had more of them I don't I don't have enough of them so I I priced it to really be read not to be profitable you make it up on on volume I guess because next thing I knew I was making more from this 99 cent short story than all of my books combined was that lower price than your prior books yeah and Amazon tries to make you not price things that low they don't want ebooks sold for that little so if you if you price it at $299 to $9.99 you make 70% of the cover price as an author which is huge traditionally published authors might make 15 and a half 18% yeah so you have to sell like five times as many books to to get the same kind of royalty but if you sell it for less than $299 or more than $9.99 then your royalty goes down to 35% so half yeah so it's a strong incentive from Amazon they want ebooks to be priced in a certain range and they incentivize that despite that you make the decision to go low yeah because you don't want a bad review someone to pay $299 for something they read in an hour no amount of money is worth the onslaught of one star reviews from Angry readers how much of that was a fear of one star reviews if you price it at$ 299 which for me still seems Dirt Cheap right you'd be surprised right versus you not really caring about the financial payoff and you just wanting to make enough to continue writing that's a leading question that might not be a driver versus something else right I'm trying to figure out I'm it's a leading question because you're leading me towards a truth that I probably wouldn't admit to myself otherwise but that's a huge part of it you're making it I'm pricing it because I want my story to get picked up and to be I want to find an audience and the proof of that is that as soon as I figured out how to make it free I did that instead so once the work was serialized and there was the five parts of wool the first part I made for free and that's a great way to to avoid one star reviews and to get more people hooked on a story yeah get more people hooked serialized how long would it take people to read all of the parts it ends up being a thck novel like 500 page novel so I'm not sure I I think I can look at this data but I think it probably takes 10 hours to read the whole thing for an average reader so we're talking about the business a little bit and I want to stay with that for just a few minutes longer and then we might come back to it but what are some other terms or Clauses where you have zigged instead of zagged done things differently where it's really been worth it do you sell worldwide rights I do not sell worldwide rights no because audio became huge foreign rights became huge I I was shocked the first time foreign deals started coming in from Brazil and Germany and it was way more than I thought I would ever get in the US for and so for context what often happens right is an author will sign a deal with a publisher they kind of sell the farm right they give they give everything over which by the way for some people might make a lot of sense right if they don't have the infrastructure or maybe if their agent isn't able or willing to do a bunch of leg work in in foreign sales but what will often happen then let's say a publisher comes to me and they make me what seems like a very rich deal and it might be a rich deal right once that ink is dry before they have wired me money they will have already had conversations with foreign Publishers and received funds from those foreign Publishers they're in the black before you get your first they're way in the black so the the sort of tear down the cheek like sob story of like we never pay authors this much who is us the Publishers not always reflection of financial reality yeah so if if that's the norm what what did you end up doing we've done just for wool probably 50 deals in other countries and then and those are so it's normal for foreign deals to be term limited like five or sevene deals and most of those would gone around and and renewed sense so it's just a constant and your agent is doing the leg work on that yeah they do and I have one primary agent in the US and I have a a European agent Jenny Meyer who's doing all these deals around Europe and then I have a an asiia specific agent who knows those and the way they know the Publishers are working with so they'll say okay here are the three offers my guy my Asian agent came to us with offers in Taiwan and he said okay these two are offering more money but this third person you've never heard of any of these Publishers but this third person is a oneman operation he does all the translation himself he only does one or two books a year you should go with him and I have no idea what you know I trust my agents so we go with this person who's offering the least amount of money and they were right like we we had the number one selling book in in Taiwan that year because people buy books because he touched them yeah not because of of me or my story that's so cool and so having these people working on your behalf it's it's enormous yeah people hear me talking about self-publishing and they think that I hate agents and I hate Publishers I hate bookstores I love all those people these are all book people and I love and I love the success of any writer however they get published if you sign with a big publisher fantastic it's so hard to do it's so hard to write a book like congratulations to everybody listening who's written a book yeah because that's that took me 20 years of like beating myself up unable to do it and and I'm I'm thrilled for everyone in this industry however they get moved forward so you are describing this process and I imagine some people listening will think to themselves I have no interest in pricing specials I have no interest in figuring out cover art that might be an exception but they might think to themselves I want to write I don't want to be a business person running a venture because I think that'll distract from my craft let's just say nothing wrong with that so if they want to go kind of hu howy Innovation light and they're like I want to go to the traditional route but I want to be smarter than the average bear what types of things would you encourage them to pay attention to I don't think you'll have any leverage going the traditional route if you're not self-published already you really have to you need something to bargain with right yeah and I I think when you're making money and leaving them out of it then you can say well I'll cut you in but this these are my demands and Publishers aren't super successful like they aren't great at picking which books are going to sell it's like Venture Capital right I mean it's it's a power law distribution if you can give them a guarantee you know Revenue stream you have a huge amount of sway that's a great point I never really thought about it because you're already ahead of the vast majority of books they will pay for up front absolutely you're like I here's guaranteed readership you know here are the reviews here are the people online who are raving about it here what people in Goodreads are saying about the book and Publishers used to think a book kind of burned out it's welcome really quickly and now they're realizing books have really long Tales success books and if you can get an Engaged readership on board it's worth so much money to have like that engaged fandom yeah to your question if you want leverage with traditional publishing if you want to ask for things that will further your rights and your career you really need to establish yourself in other ways and doesn't have to be from self-publishing it could have a have a podcast that's super successful platform a website a huge following on social media something that reduces their perceived risk that's where you have that's exactly it that's exactly it I read in the process of doing research which is always fun for me to do with friends when I have them on the podcast because otherwise it'd be really creepy to do like a bunch of like Google sleuthing on my friends and I was wondering I think you gave the advice and I'm wondering if it still applies that writers not take days off that's one that could be one of those don't believe everything you read on the internet the second is related to writing for I think it was a book review website and becoming accustomed to working on Deadline and I just love you to speak to the importance of that because I know for me I think of myself occasionally as a writer if I don't have a deadline man I am not terribly productive yeah so there's the deadline piece if you could speak to that and then just how you would suggest people train themselves to write is it daily is it few days a week is it something else so I can only speak to what works for me but I will say that I found that I have way more in common with other writers than I then we are dissimilar like I hear the same laments like you were just mentioning I know you and I have a lot of the same uh Hang-Ups about writing and the famous the famous quote about writing is I hate writing but I love having written yeah right everyone loves to have like gotten some pages behind them and I tried for 20 years to be a writer from age 12 to 32 my number one bucket list thing in life is to write a book and no one was stopping me but myself but for 20 years I couldn't do it and honestly like all I had to do was write a little bit every day and I would write a book that's all I ever wanted and so how can you get in the way of yourself that consistently and we all do it as writers and once I unlock the ability to write my fear was ever turning that switch back off and that's where I think the daily habit is critical like I wrote today before I came here and it's Saturday MH and I'll write on a on the plane and I'll write in the back of an Uber I'll do whatever it takes to get some words in that day is there a certain amount or is it just something it used to be I used to try to do like 2,000 words a day wow I know it's a lot of words yeah now if I do a thousand words a day and what I find helpful in my word document whatever I'm working on there's the word count written in the document at the end wherever I'm writing and when I start my daily as I'm writing I can see at the bottom of the word document what the current word count is and I can just see the comparison and that gives me my like you need to do a little more and then once I'm done for the day I update that number to the day's number and so I'm always just trying to March that that forward it sounds calculated and cold but if you just sit around waiting for inspiration and try to write a few sentences here and there you'll never stay with the story enough to know what it's even about so when you said you effectively when you turned on the spigot you were afraid of turning it off so you kept up this daily practice but how did you after so many years turn it on in the first place like what was the Catalyst what was the you mentioned the review website I was writing for so I was trying to help a friend get this crime mystery thriller website up and running and he was doing the film movie side of it and I was doing the books and I just put a call out to Publishers that we it was a beautiful website that he had made so I was sharing the URL of saying this is what we're doing and I started getting a flood of books in the mail like and for a reader like me this was like Christmas every day I was getting more books than I could review so I was having to go through and see which ones appealed to me and I was building bookshelves all over my house to house these things for one genre yeah for one genre and but it was the biggest genre it was like the one that Publishers make a lot of their money on in order to keep up with it I started reading and reviewing a book a day and this is all I was doing I've done this in college too i' gone through a period of like like two years where I was reading a book a day as a challenge and some of these are you know 400 page books so you're not doing much else yeah just that I didn't know how good this was going to be for my writing but absorbing that much Pros just made it so easy for me to tap into not only the ability to string words together but all the plot elements that I was absorbing from weeks and weeks and weeks of of absorbing this many books and then I was also writing that review every day and so I was getting a daily writing habit it wasn't even a job I wasn't getting paid to do this I was doing it for a friend to try to get a website going because I love reading MH but that experience is what made it possible for me to write is there any Mount Rushmore of fiction books they come to mind this is not a fixed list but whatever comes to mind if you were if you were to say and I'll I'll make this personal so I've been experimenting with short fiction for the last year or so I think I will do quite a bit more possibly in screenplay format which I definitely want to talk to you about at some point oh cool but what are some books people should consume or that I might want to consume to provide myself with really good nutrition for absorbing some of what you're describing I think reading beautiful Pros is almost like striking a tuning fork before your writing session I think it's really awesome to pick up there's several things you can do you can read stuff that's nonsense but beautiful like some PR and you can just turn to any part of PR it's all the same the beginning of a story reads just like the middle of the stories but the way a good translation of PR flows that iic pentameter the runon sentences it's like it's you start to hear the tonal quality of good music music in words and then you can start to sing in that key yourself some of the books I've read recently that have I think upped my writing one was this is how you lose the time War which is so good yeah it's so good that is an incredible book and it's short and it's one of those that you could just pick up and read again to like remind yourself what writing can sound like also fascinating because it was written by two authors yeah who alternated back alternated back and forth and and which is structural to the story which works Cersei have you read that I haven't yet read it I have seen so many people reading it I've seen friends reading it took me forever to read that the pros in that book is so special and will make you a better writer MH just recently it's another one that someone recommended was tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow oh I haven't heard of it I tried to read that like five times and it was the hottest thing and I never gave it enough of a chance but when I finally finished it I was like that's that's what I'm made me for with my writing no kidding why did it take you five times I've heard this from a lot of people so if you hear this recommendation and you want to read the book get through the first like 70 or 80 pages and I know it's like I'd rather read something that's captur me from the first page this book pays off mhm so those are recent books that have that have found you recommended linoln highway to me linoln Highway which I thought was spectacular anything by amore amore tolls is one of the it's just a book full of literary and narrative magic tricks it's wild he upsets me because he he he wasn't even a writer as his primary career oh no one of those yeah yeah super successful investment banker you know it's like Michael Lewis kind of story like super successful all the ways but it turns out the quality of reading that he does and he's just one of the smartest human beings I've ever met but his writing there's a there's a short story collection coming out by him this year called a table for two oh can't wait to read it get it on day one because there's one short story in particular on there that is the cleverest thing I've ever read so he's another one that I'll read his Works in order to remind myself like what we're aiming for his word smithing is beautiful yeah but it's it's not PR right it doesn't strive to be that it's clear but it's so clear and the story arcs and character development and the weaving right he's like sitting at a loom of pros and just like weaving these carpets and you don't see the finished pattern until after you say an hour and you're like oh my God I didn't see that coming at all he's a genius and he works hard at it you know it spends the the years and time it takes that's a level of writing that it's fun to Aspire to but I I'll never reach but you have to have like loftier goals than than you know your your expected outcome so update for you this is just personal on my side is that that and you have been along for the ride here so I'm working on my First Book Project in six years or so and I'm am collaborating with a friend of mine because I had written 72,000 words of this maybe five years ago and then thrown on the towel I was like I just don't have what it takes to get this to the Finish Line because I recognize I'm seasoned enough I recognize what it's going to take to get this to where I'll be happy with it right and to scratch that impostor syndrome and actually be satisfied enough that I would put it out in the world and this friend of mine kept bugging me about it because he wanted to read it and I was like well if you want to read it so badly you write it yeah you write it or you help me write it yeah get it to the finish line and it is so far we've been working on it for a few months and inspired by a lot of your stories about collaborating with writing Partners on the TV side yeah has been a blast it has been so much fun it has been so much in better writing with someone it's been so great cuz we destroy ourselves when we do it alone right brutal it's just being like locked in the padded cell yeah with your own mind and it's been great the book is not done it's who knows where it will go but it is I can say at the very least it is already partially succeeded and I see that as such a tremendous unlock for myself I've been such a solo operator that and the quality is good right it's not finished it's not fully polished but I was like okay like this is actually working and at this point you know based on our lunches and conversations I'm planning on probably doing effectively as much self-publishing as possible and then potentially a print only deal and what I have been surprised by I'd love to get your take on this I've talked to a couple Publishers just why not right like I'm friends with a number of people who are yeah and I've worked with folks and the idea of a print only deal off the table really for bigger Publishers wow now there are some like clever workarounds that I had one publisher who's who I won't name but is like a distribution deal like a 50/50 well they they do the profit sharing stuff but they want all formats yeah and then there have been options where people have said look what we could do is like buy All rights but then basically give you an exclusive license back for those other formats so in practice like you'll get what you want but publicly we have to say we got all rights and that's why they do that so I can give you some behind the scenes stuff I want some behind the scenes I would love it two things that I found fascinating one I heard from people in the industry because I got to know like editors and a chief at many of the publishing houses over the years going to conferences and kind of talking on a business side I don't even get called in to talk to some publishing houses that I didn't even publish with and one of the things I heard was a publisher who gave me a printon deal got phone calls from all the other Publishers blasting them oh I'm sure because the deal got listed in like sets a precedent exactly the whole idea that competition exists in the marketplace it's insane yeah the contracts all look the same the terms are all the same the dollar amounts are all the same it's like just as this quick side note I remember I I threw my one and only like event like a conference was like 50 people super proud of it blew all the money that I made on like producing the event and it was in Napa and I was like why do all of these catering services charge $8 a cup of coffee yeah that's a little fishy I no that surprised me that Publishers weren't willing to do deals because of the stigma and the social pressure from other Publishers yeah like do the things that they won't do get that next Tim Ferris book when no one else will yeah so that was really that was kind of disappointing but surprising one of the things that happened one publisher gave me a really good printon deal with a time limit then made an offer for the sequels and wouldn't give me the same terms for the sequel so they thought that I was going to be trapped like now giving them all the rights so I was self-publishing sequels while they were publishing the first book which creates a really awkward like what I'm so what leverage did they think they had yeah they had nothing they thought I think they thought once I had a taste for the publishing life once you had a taste of the High Life yeah rolling around in your richy Rich car I take a pay cut to go with Publishers great p i i it's like I I make less money to do a publishing deal than I do to self-publish why do the publishing deals at all because you can reach different readers you might not reach more readers because the pricing will be less appetizing in a lot of ways but you'll get in different distribution channels and so it opens up new avenues it's also for me once the money was no longer an issue because you know probably two years into my self-publishing of wool like I didn't have to I was going to be able to live off that for the rest of my life then I can make decisions that were just like what's what's creatively fun yeah like I I want to work with these Publishers because we get to do box sets and special editions and mhm go do a twoe book tour that I would never organize on my own but that a publisher has all the infrastructure to set up and do book tour let's talk about promotion for a second where do you fall on promotion because I believe like after your first book or it might have been wool tell me which it was it might have been after your first book came out you started working on your second book and I want to say your dad maybe was like what are you doing to promote the first book yeah okay you tell my is hilarious okay so could you expand on this and then I'd love to just hear kind of where you fall on promotion cuz it can be helpful or it can be a huge distraction sometimes both yes often both my dad was amazing he didn't know anything about books or book sales or any of that but he knew every small business owner in the town that he grew up in and the town that he lived in in Colorado and when I published like next thing I know he's got a table in front of like a someone's coffee shop like places you wouldn't expect to see books being sold and he's driving me around we'll do like three or four of these in a day and I would do this for like the week that I was hanging out with him and visiting supposed to be hanging out playing J Ry or cribbage instead we're just doing like these book you're in front of the hardware store with books totally and you would sit there all day and maybe sell you know five books if you were on a good day so it makes no sense financially you're better off spending that day writing but I will say if you can find something that you enjoy that counts as promotion MH tap into that and for me that was engaging with readers on Facebook I didn't realize this was promotional work until I saw how it snowballed my sales but instead of and I've never been comfortable asking someone who's never read my stuff to go read it I've never pushed my book on people but what I have done is tried to like engage with people who've already enjoyed it and I think that it works for me emotionally because I have the feedback loop of my writing is you know doing something it's got an audience I'm getting a a little positive reinforcement so it made me feel less alone but it also made them talk about my books more on their page or with their friends or family other people would see this interaction like what do you what's this person really jazzed about and they get curious about it so blogging being on social media putting out little videos it looks like promotional work but it was basically therapy for me to feel like I wasn't doing this just by myself and I wasn't all alone in this not feeling alone you've been doing a lot more collaboration in the last I guess handful of years yeah why do you that and what have you found are the keys for you in good collaboration personality is the number one thing if you can just get along with your co-creator and it doesn't feel like you're work anymore you're just having fun my my co-writer in all things TV and film is this guy named Matt mados who's an amazing author and his own right beautiful screenwriter he's already had some TV and film stuff out there and we started working together on a script for fun and realized this is better than doing this individually so now we just do all of our projects together and spending time with him brainstorming story and and Diving up writing and working on scripts I forget that it's work it's so much fun so let's focus on that last part how do you work together in the sense that you actually ship things mhm you and your partnership things so there must be some process with deadlines and so on are you working on multiple projects at once do you do one at a time how do you divy up responsibilities like what does a week in the life or a month in the life look like we usually have something that needs our attention more than other things but there was a there was a day a few weeks ago where we pushed five projects forward on the same day these are all TV tv/ film TV and film and they all have a good chance of going to the next phase so they're all they'll have momentum behind them and yeah that blew our minds we're like did we work on five things today normally it's one maybe two things this last week we got a a two-page pitch out to a a studio that was waiting on it and then went back into a rewrite of a pilot that we're working on a brand new IP for another major studio and when you say we went into a rewrite is one person at the keyboard not to get too bolts are good cuz like it's how do you figure this out we've done both what we find now is we write an outline like a rough outline together brainstorming then we write a detailed outline the kind of thing that you would show a producer and then once you have that detailed outline I'm like I just feel act two right now like I I know where that's going to go we already have all the Beats so we don't have to debate anything and I'll just be working on act two and when you look up act one's also written which is one of the best feelings as a writer it's like having those little you know Gremlins Who come out at night and do like all the work because your partner's working on act one while you're working on act two yeah MH and it's more than a doubling it feels like you triple or quadruple your output also because like you now you have a deadline you have a social deadline they're working so you have to work and you're doing the same thing for them are there any other mistakes common mistakes that you see because you're known as someone who has experimented with self-publishing you're known as someone who has tried a lot of things in publishing so you must get a lot of questions and a lot of stories from various people who are attempting to take on Creative projects on some level what are some other mistakes we've talked about a few in this conversation so far but maybe other common mistakes that you see the number one mistake I see Will undermine everything else I'm about to say because I think it's trusting expertise can get you in trouble uhhuh okay the industry is changing all the time and so even what I know might be outdated and and I'm still operating on it like I remember early on someone telling me that audiobooks were going to be the next biggest thing and this is way before they blew up they saw it before anyone else and that the advice they gave me like changed my career in a big big big big way changed because you retained your audio rights yeah and so I started focusing on creating audiobooks and launching them with the books and making sure the production value is really high I just thought it was like an extra format I didn't know it was going to be one of the money drivers yeah so trusting your gut is often going against the established wisdom and that can be really beneficial there's just so much change happening you might have an idea no one else has had so being your own expert I think is one of the keys a common mistake I see people make is thinking that readers won't follow you across genres so you see people spread out their name amongst different pin names I'm going to write under this for sci-fi and under this for romance and this is my non-fiction stuff and the brand is you and if people enjoy your Pros they'll follow you to other genres so really consolidate your identity and unless you have a reason to not write under your real name embrace your writing under your real name and make sure that you are the brand MH the more readers can feel a connection with the person behind the work better off your career will be I'm convinced of that I think the relationship I have with my readers and the first thousand fans I remember when we had like a thousand people on Facebook the fans on Facebook were calling themselves the first thousand they were really proud of being early and I still have a relationship with all of them today like 14 years later that's amazing that Bond was so real and so in and I think anyone who tells you to shy away from that might be leading you astray this reminds me of some behind the scen stuff I was going to mention earlier when you were talking about different rights in different regions I had a publisher offering we were trying to do a printon deal before the first one and they were like no we we we'll give you a million dollars for all the rights but we won't you know partiel these things out and they were talking about how the print was so important and I was like well I'll do the print with you for free you don't have to give me any money and they wouldn't do that deal okay because I was like I'm making enough money on the ebook I'll give you the print for free you run off of the print version make whatever you want that's wild cut me into a little bit of royalty but no Advance at all the other Syndicate families would be very upset well they all said no which and then I realized they're all talking down about digital rights and trying to sell me on a beautiful print edition but then when I would offer them the print rights for free they were like no but we'll give you a million for everything they were telling me what the digital was worth yeah yeah in the business conversation but in the creative conversations they were telling me digital was worthless and so I think that was really eye opening for me it's a bit of a tell yeah it was a tell you know and I should be fair in saying that I I spoke with one or two kind of mid midsized Publishers who are absolutely game for print only yeah but the big boys and girls and I won't name names but anyone who's part of like what used to be called the five or six sisters I can't recall there's been some consolidation it was down to five is it still five or is it four now I think it's still five but it's like Highlander yeah yeah not as Immortal but not as Immortal they've been unwilling to my perspective right I don't have any evence here but break rank right like they're not going to break formation in their defense I would say I understand that if that becomes the new normal they have to go they will necessarily have to go through major reorgs right I mean I would imagine yeah unless they are able to create new revenue streams in in some capacity which I'm sure will happen at some point I just don't know what form that would take they would have to cut expenses they base themselves in the most expensive real estate there's a lot of bloat there's a lot of access that could be cut and they've cut a lot it used to be you know the 2hour lunches and the it was kind of a very Breezy industry yeah before the Big Box retailers it's not even Amazon that changed it it was the pressure that Barnes & Noble and borders and those guys cuz they were doing huge discounts and demanding unbelievable deals from Publishers yeah in order to move big volume so things started changing probably in the early '90s but there's still room to cut if they wanted to room to cut so let's talk about peering into the future a bit last time we hung out I want to say you showed me a number of cover mockups and they weren't just mockups they looked great and you said I made this in however much time it was not a whole lot of time with AI and I'm curious how you think AI is going to change let's say book creation and book publishing because it's hard for me to imagine a corner of that that it won't touch yeah it's going to touch everything eventually yeah the same way electricity and computation have I Kevin I believe is the first one Kevin Kelly to point out that we like electrified everything and then we added compute to everything and then we're going to add AI to everything and everything you can say about AI will all be wrong in the future so the really hard pronouncements people make are hilarious like AI would never be a to do this like we have no idea we just invented this like these new language models are are you know less than a few years old right now what AI can do is lift your worst skill up to like 80% minimum of what an expert can do so I I don't have any cover art ability and you can see that with my old self-published cover art but now I can get to 80% of an industry veteran on my own in a single day and that's that's GameChanger M but we're doing a a deluxe edition of wool that'll be out later this year which I'm probably upsetting Somebody by talking about it but we're going with a traditional cover artist because for something that's important we want to a contribute to the other Arts but also get it right and have the feedback loop to like make this the best cover art possible but for the next things that I sell I wouldn't hesitate to use AI to create something that was good enough that I loved cuz I was already doing this with like terrible Photoshop what do you think about on the on the text Pros story book side because I would imagine and I don't know this for a fact but I would have to imagine that there is already an avalanche of AI generated books hitting self-publishing it's already happened Amazon changed our policy around around it to limit the number of books you could upload in a short period of time yeah okay yeah so where do you think that goes I mean how do you think that will impact the ecosystem I think there will be authors who no longer have a seat on the bus because of it because there'll be enough AI generated books to make some readers happy and those readers are no longer buying books from another author there's already more books in the public domain than any one could ever read and these are Classics these are like not self-published books which can also be great this is the the great Russian literature this is you know everything written more than 100 years ago it's all free to read and you can download them all that does not stop people from having amazing careers yeah so the idea that there'll be too much to read and so no one will make a living that's always been true I'm not sure what AI would change about that well I suppose what I'm wondering is for instance if somebody has I guess Amazon as the dominant player here in the US at least will have to just get very good at different types of filters in the sense that much like if someone comes out with a hit product let's let's call it matter horn making this up whatever there's a new product called matter horn with two ends at the end yeah and if that product takes off within a few weeks there are going to be fake websites there are going to be people advertising on Google to try to poach that traffic yeah and maybe happens all the time right so I would imagine the same exact thing would happen on publishing platforms if people are able to quickly generate so it was already happening where people would download even some of my books they would download them copy and paste the whole thing change the title in the cover and re-upload it and they would start be selling copies yeah they would do that to Wikipedia articles oh they just use Wikipedia articles yeah they just copy and paste and then say like you know it's a gardening series and and it's about every tree and here's my book on sycamores and it's the Wikipedia entry it's totally illegal yeah that is pretty close to an accurate description of someone who I know made millions of dollars doing this very thing it was like a gardening specific kind of Wikipedia plagiarism so that's already happening and Amazon somebody made millions of dollars doing that yeah wow well cuz they had thousands of titles up and each one was generating a little stream of money wow okay yeah Amazon is been playing whack-a-mole with these kinds of schemes for a long time as soon as you open you know the the floodgates up like this you're dealing with everyone thought self publishing would be a problem we were amazing like we were providing great books at great prices for a lot of people it's all the little scams that were in issue what are the opportunities hiding in the threats right when I see this because I've also seen some fears around unemployment which I think are are valid in a lot of respects I would disagree strongly with Kevin on that right I think he wrote in his wired piece that he felt net net no one would lose jobs because of AI I disagree with that but are there any opportunities that you see and I guess we kind of telegraphed some of it in terms of getting skills up to 80% of an industry veteran but as you think about all of the noise it's going to be generated and all of the experimentation that's going to happen which is intrinsically interesting to me what are some of maybe the opportunities that people might not see or things that come to mind for you because I think of for instance I'll throw one out there which is just Conquering the empty page so if I could use voice to kind of ramble my ideas which I'm very good at doing they come out pretty polished I'm like man I wish I could have just written that so many times I'll I'll say something to to Mt my writing partner and it comes out perfect and neither one of us are typing and I'm like we will never get that back will we that is gone no exactly so if I could do that into an AI who would clean it up make a few suggestions boom I've just conquered the empty page yeah and now I have something once I have Clay like on the table to work with now I now I can work with it revising is like so much easier than writing so much easier right so that would be one example where I could see AI enabling me to do better more consistent writing I'm wondering if other other use cases come to mind yeah that's a really good one one thing I'll say about go back to Kevin's net unemployment I think he can be right but it doesn't make it any easier because net unemployment means a whole bunch of people are losing jobs while a bunch of other people are finding new things to do yeah and that transition is painful mhm and we've gone through it many times so yeah I would also say the people who are finding new things to do are likely the people who are already employed or most capable to find employment whereas a lot of the folks who are going to lose jobs are going to have I think a very tough time in terms of reskilling it's going to be tough what's Wild is how low unemployment is right now and has been for a while all these disruptions are happening yeah right gig economy I mean you there have been a lot of scares over the last a lot of scares handful of decades so we'll see and you know last year was supposed to be a recession for sure and you know this year for sure but all the indicators are pointing in a better Direction I think AI will be one of the biggest challenges we go through mhm because there'll be an existential like we anthropomorphize our our boats and our cars and our mechanical things but imagine what we're going to do when it's robots and and we're talking to mhm and it's just now starting to happen Chad GPT was never really made to be a conversationalist but some of these like there's one called pie there's one called replica replica Sheila there's these handful that are so conversational and they're brand new and already with my wife and I like pie is like a person that's living in our pocket like it's so endearing and so I'm not there's an existential why you use it for lots of reasons if we're like there only four states that have the same like the capital start with the same letter as the state like I think that's right asking Pi is so much more fun than Googling it getting the weather like if we're traveling to La like what's the weather going to be like and at the end of this conversation Pi's like stay dry you know like it's just we're wired to talk the way you and I are talking right now and our machines are going to get wired up that way and we're not going to be able to get enough of it yeah and so I think the occupational crisis is going to be one thing I think there's an existential crisis that we're going to face when we realize what you and I do is computational but our brains are large language models we're not that special yeah we can replicate the human soul in a lot of ways I think people are going to have a hard time with that yeah I'd say so I'm having a hard time with it and I'm Pro it I'm all for it so you're also I would say one of the most optimistic folks I know yet you're right about the end of the world so true how do you reconcile those two things I'm a short-term optim I'm a midterm Optimist even okay midterm Optimist I'm a long-term pessimist uhhuh we know for sure either the Big Crunch or the heat death of the universe is looming what's the Big Crunch well the Big Crunch is there's enough gravity that the Universe collapses back in on itself back to Singularity and that's going to mean every bit of information and data that we've ever formed every memory every Relic every manuscript becomes a pinpoint yeah so nothing matters in the long run the heat death is things keep expanding and you know entropy wins all the Suns run out of energy they all become Brown dwarfs and even those cool and eventually the universe becomes lifeless MH so either we're running the clock down or the clock is like been thrown up in the air billions of years right yeah 15 billion but most people aren't going to worry too much about that yeah well I think everyone should embrace if they if they can Embrace that nothing is forever that 15 billion years is functionally a long time but it's not forever then now we're just talking numbers now we all agree you know it's all we're all [\\xa0__\\xa0] we can agree and now it's just like how many years and some people think it's five years which I think is crazy we're not the environment is not the number one threat that we have you know it's it's not the thing that's going to end us Comet nuclear warfare all these like short-term crises have never been an existential threat none of them have ever been an existential threat but we treat them like it MH so I think in the short and Med medium term we'll be fine but the question will we be here 200 years from now which I consider the start of the long term is iffy because if we can build the a technology that would end us all and it have to be very specific targeted technology someone will use it mhm if we all woke up tomorrow and this is a common thought experiment if we all woke up tomorrow with a button around our neck and it said if you press this every human will die the question is how long do you give us yeah right it's a fraction of a second yeah as soon as all 8 billion people finish reading that sentence someone's going to push it and so the only question that matters is are we developing that button and one way we would develop that button would be to have crisper level genetic engineering that you could do in your basement M nanotechnology where we could develop a virus that infects everyone but lays dormant for 10 years and activates all simultaneously so you don't have time to develop a resistance or if we ever develop a battery that has infinite storage capacity that would be really bad because you could set up a set up a drone we're seeing what drones are doing in Ukraine right now this new warfare M but imagine to launch a drone from Chicago that can go to the other side of the planet and all that's limiting that right now is Battery Technology GPS making explosives all that's pretty easy so we're actively trying to build this button that would create problems I'm wondering if maybe that's not a great idea maybe we should slow down our pace is that even possible though a lot like talking about safety precautions and ethics boards related to AI I mean my feeling is that ship has really already sailed by and large like you can you could regulate on a like a Geo fenced limited basis but this is a global playing field yeah I hear that argument the last time we went through something like this was when the nuclear bombs went off in Japan and people said this is worth fearing this is like yeah this is more evil than our brains can comprehend we don't want everyone having this and the systems we put in place were pretty good at limiting I mean everyone knows how to build a nuclear bomb it's like yeah most of the science hard Sciences out there yeah you know I don't take us too yeah we can go way off to too too off track but there's no track but I would say that when you're dealing with enriched uranium or very limited resources that can be tracked and locked down it's one thing but when you're dealing with like gpus and open source code for so that's the difference so when gpus are a limited resource Source yeah and people who've gone through the Bitcoin mining phase and couldn't get a GPU for their video games saw how limiting it can be what's different now is we have these things that could be crises and instead of saying we need Regulators we need instead we're like oh Nvidia is worth investing our money in like this is one of the best stocks and so the people making the thing that's dangerous we're actually just pouring gas on it and saying that's the purpose now like we should all try to make as much money as possible and so we're going out this a little differently no let me ask you if if you don't mind yeah a deeply personal question don't have to answer it if you don't want how do you think about kids if 200 years iffy what a great question because my wife and I started embryos like two days ago wow all right so Ely she's still recovering from the procedure I had mine a week before and as funny as I reached out to a mutual friend of ours your procedure's a little easier oh actually I don't know which procedure we're talking about it was tough Oh I thought we were just talking about forced extraction oh forced extraction yeah needles what yeah wait now now sorry now here we go it was rough wait forced extraction snipped oh okay I was going to say otherwise it's just some bad videos in a cup in a room I still feel it oh oh that sounds awful okay all right I retract my as personal as you want to go D okay so kids 200 years out and that's not that long in human in human time right yeah I mean if you take 100y old people who exist at any point in time and line them up back to back like it's not that many you can like to get back to the Egyptians is is one small room of people right I think if you try to decide on whether or not to have kids based on how what kind of life you think they're going to have no one would have kids cuz you nothing's a guarantee like life is going to be weird yeah you and I have been through a global pandemic we've been through a crazy terrorist attack on our soil that you know I was a Ground Zero for my parents didn't if they would have known the things that I would have seen they might they might not have had me yeah but those things didn't make me miserable like I I think our set point of happiness and we can do a whole podcast about this is pretty fixed you mean from birth yeah from birth I think it's we're kind of closer to height than we would like to think it's closer to height that's the best I've ever heard anybody present that I'm going to steal that so my wife and I want to have kids because we think it might be the best adventure that we ever go down we think we would be great parents and we think life for whenever you live it as a a surf you know hundreds of years ago like human life has been terrible for most people for most of human history MH and yet I bet there isn't a human who hasn't laughed who hasn't felt love no matter what their situation was our condition is so complex and there's so much of it that makes all the rest of it worthwhile H so I don't think there'll ever be a time that a human life isn't worth having I think the numbers yeah you know we we're no longer having an average of seven or eight per couple yeah so we're over that danger we're actually going to enter into a much bigger danger which is a huge population crash I was talking to Kevin recently and it was actually intended to be a podcast but it was a Walkin talk and I screwed up the tech and didn't record the conversation ended up being a great conversation with Kevin nonetheless it's one of my favorite things to do is to walk and talk with yeah and I said Kevin is there anything he said well I think this is tractable and I think this is tractable I was like Kevin I don't think there's anything you think is intractable so yeah we have to state that bias up front and he said no no no I think I found something you can hear Kevin SP say he's like no no no I found something I think that might be intractable and I was like wow tell me please this is so exciting and he seted the population implosion oh yeah that we might not be able to fix and we had a long conversation about to was lost Into The Ether but it's one of the disagreements I have with a friend who thinks settling space is super important because we can greatly increase the number of people without hurting the planet and I do not see how we will increase the number of people like I think that is will never come back because the hedonistic reward for having your fifth kid is will never be as great as your first kid yeah and I really apologize to all fifth kids who are hearing this but the joy just has to get less over time with anything that we do mhm and so a lot of people I know that you and I know are either having no kids one kid or maybe two kids yeah that's Max but very few for every couple we know or single two single people we know not having kids we need to know a couple having four kids I went to this beautiful Shabbat dinner last night and I'm not I'm not Jewish but it was beautiful dinner amazing and tons of kids tons of grandkids and I was thinking wow struck me I was like well what happens as the population gets smaller but the percentage of deeply religious people goes up this should happen eventually right I would imagine that I mean it seems almost inevitable just if you if you run the numbers right so far the opposite like we're becoming more secular over time but there's a funny article out there about when we will all be Amish because if you just look at the trends statistically yeah 100% certain that everyone in the United States will be Amish at some point that's only because you're you're carrying out trends that won't stick around right right right but it is true that people with more Traditional Values one of those being having a big family to instill your values in ever more people yeah that is going to change the makeup and maybe preserve something that we were losing anyway because we were we we're dropping religion like nothing what is your take on religion so I was militant atheist for a long time in part because I saw my friend go down a really horrible path and yeah I won't spend a whole lot of time on it but I I I sort of studied up to try to rescue him from basically being inducted into this very extreme cult which had religious orientation and I don't know if I've ever talked about this publicly I got to the point where I I could basically match all of his arguments and he's and he is a very bright guy he's very well educated and he just went through a brutal time in his life and the safety net ended up being this person he met it was like come to my church and got inducted into this group which was pretty sort of theologically weaponized pretty scary stuff we're very vulnerable to that weapon yeah and he and I kind of went toe totoe I was trying to get him out of this situation and I won't go into the nitty-gritty of it cuz people lose their minds uh as happens but I I figured out the argument that would kind of defeat the last remaining resistance that he had wow to my position and when I looked at his face because I was like edging into it and I realized like the only thing this guy has in his life right now you might be taking that away from him is this religion and I decided not to do it cuz I was like wait a second it like hit me last minute I was like this is actually really selfish of me cuz I don't have to live his life yeah I've been where you were and we need justification for the extreme change that we've made in our Viewpoint yeah and so we need someone to agree with us so that we know that we're doing the right thing yeah I was raised very religious by the age of 12 I was complete atheist I told my parents I no longer believe in God and I went through a period where I was a militant atheist where I was like no one else should believe in God either yeah and I forgive myself for going through that face cuz I was young and it was it was like having to drive in the other ditch for a while because i' been in another ditch yeah I now feel like I'm on at least this like pretty bumpy road with the ditches on either side of me and I have so much compassion for people in both ditches like I just don't judge the way I used to and everyone's trying to figure out the way through life any of us could be wrong and I think we need to embrace that yeah but whether or not someone is being good to themselves and others is pretty easier to ascertain than whether or not their pomological system is accurate totally so if they're being abusive if they're not giving their kids room to be creative and curious and you know pounding their belief system into people before they're old enough to think for themselves I think that can be really abusive and I think if you if you trust in your system if you trust in your religion then your kids and people around you will find it as well you can do it through being a good person yeah you don't have to do the indoctrination thing that I see a lot of same goes for atheism you know Playing devil's advocate there I mean I find captivating the idea that religion has some deep Fitness value like Evol evolutionary value because it's so prevalent which is not to say it justifies all of the atrocities that can be seen perpetrated in the name of religion and there's plenty of beautiful things and many many Beautiful Things music works of art you name it right Community Building lot of science lot of original science was coming out of absolutely lot of amazing science and just the sheer prevalence and persistence over time despite in some plac is persecution right yeah is it like birds building bird nests right is there some evolutionary inherent drive that is coded into us that leads us to pursue what we label as religion I don't know I have no idea I I just I just find the sheer persistence and durability of it very interesting it's very interesting well our Superstition will never go away and I think religion is a much more benign Superstition than some of the other ones that we've seen lately these deep conspiracy theories that people lose reality to not that believing in religion isn't also losing a sense of reality but watching the qanon right like that that was some of that was a gap left by a loss of religion I think I'm so glad you said that because I you I think a lot about and I'm blanking on the exact writing or speech from David Foster Wallace but the gist of it is we all worship something the key is to know what you worship right if that's a good line and if religion is removed from the picture you still find people who will like die for CrossFit die for veganism die for qanon die for fill in the blank die for atheism yeah right like I know atheists who are the most devout dogmatic people I've ever met yeah right and' be devastated if God appeared and like I'm the kind of atheist where if God appeared I'd be like sweet I've got questions let's can we talk yeah some of these militant atheists with like capital S you know skepticism I'm like wait a minute you guys have all the trappings of a religion you just don't have like the you just don't have Heaven you got all these trappings at some point I realized we all serve a purpose yeah but there's criminality to all these things too and I think the thing that that really should wake us up to the dangers is like how many children were abused in the Catholic church because of a very small arbitrary change of just not allowing your leaders to be married people it's just it's a filtering mechanism yeah and so once you see that make that change and the fact that the religion is so dogmatic that it can make a change that will make the lives better of innocent children yeah like that's the kind of thing that's pretty easy to turn people off on religion as a whole for and it's so easy to change yeah and that's a frustration you know that let's let's see where we can make a small change and make lives better how do you think about a set of rules or moral codes for yourself and I'm particularly interested in asking you this because you were raised religious so you have had exposure to presets yeah right like the on the menu options I believe in an objective moral truth okay I don't know exactly what it is but I think that we're all working toward the same kind of in the same direction just Asm totic so I don't think values and mores are necessarily subjective and cult why do you believe in an objective truth is that just a decision you made to hold that as a belief one thing I don't believe in is Free Will oh boy I knew was coming that's another another conversation podcast yeah um I've encountered a lot of different time on your behalf yeah exactly when I heard the argument for objective moral truth and it resonated with me it made more sense than made that argument a lot of people have but one of the best was a Teaching Company course was a like a Harvard Professor philosophy I don't remember the name of the course because there were several about ethics that I love but one was about the idea that world truth is objective and it's like you know 40 hours of lectures about this okay and I found myself getting a whiplash I was nodding my head so much through it all it it really synthesized a lot of things that I already believed in grass stap but told them well we just see more in common with each other that we do dis similar mhm one thing that we're not touching on in this conversation is the years I spent sailing around the world done more sailing than writing we we had to make some creative decisions time constraints exactly but the thing that I learned visiting all these countries sailing across the Pacific going to really remote vience and meeting remote people is that we're the same everywhere and we have to be really creative and finding differences to talk about because the way we love our kids the way we love each other the way we laugh the way we spend our days is so similar that we have to like oh they wear this kind of clothes and we wear these kind of clothes and those are different but we're both wearing clothes yeah right we have to really find ways that we're not alike and the fact that I can read The Iliad 2,000 year old story written in a different language in a different time and the human emotion of it resonates with me today I understand the the fear and the jealousy and the conniving and all the things that were going on means that in that other culture 2,000 years ago we were the same yeah and so how can moral truth be subjective when we're the same as a people that's my best argument for it but also we're just moving in the same direction we see a step backward here but the two steps forward Ward we're just heading more and more towards this universal truth where we all want to be treated about the same way in general and we think the fair system is that if you treat me in that way I'll treat you in that way as well MH and even when we do the math and we make Game Theory things we find this tit fortat Game Theory algorithm to win out over every other algorithm we can come up with and it's one of complete fairness equal retribution and short memory like as soon as you're nice to me I'll be nice to you again as soon as you break the rules I'm going to put you in your place mhm and if you cooperate with a tit fortat algorithm you both benefit completely and human history seems to to reinforce that and the Golden Rule so much of which we find in almost every ethical and religious system at least some sense of treat others as you want to be treated I think objective moral truth is right there and everyone else is trying to cheat that system mhm we all are even you and I are trying to like okay how can we believe that but then get a little bit more out of the system than we're willing to give up how do we violate the commons just a little bit and most of our criminality and ethical dilemas are all coming from us violating our own objective deviating from the code yeah you know I was just going to go into this whole whole entire new chapter of of personal line of questions but we are we're starting to descend from Cru altitude beginning to land the plane so let me instead we'll do round two sometime we can have lunch and talk anytime too well of course we can I forget we're even doing a podcast right yeah we're going to hang out and I'll ask you the question which relates to your religious upbringing but I'm going to bookmark that and save for another time while we are recording is there anything else you'd like talk talk about got let's call it five minutes man I want to do one of these where I can just get to drill you with questions deal has someone done that to you yet you know I've only done it you've done it other people's yeah maybe once in recent memory but it was very specific to I'd say predominantly Tech with uh venture capitalist so rare there's so much happening in life right now like the Journey of adapting something into the scope and scale of Silo which I had a Hollywood friend tell me like you know you got the last one of those deals right because the strikes all happen because these things have gotten ridiculous in budget ways and won't turn a profit being in the last wave of that was really exciting and working with the creative people who made that happen and watching fans just get rewarded for the the show being ahead I could talk about sailing forever like some of those Adventures you wouldn't believe and the best thing that's ever happened to me is my wife who you've gotten to know really well and US setting off on having having a family Congratulations by the way which you know I was talking to a friend I was like what do you think about kids and he was like Have you listened to my podcast with T so you might know who this is but I was like huh you're not going to tell me I like no you have to go listen to the podcast so I had to go find out what he thought about having kids well we can talk about yeah we talk about off the air but it's funny you're like getting this out of more and more of your interviewees yeah well it's on my mind too cool I want to talk about that next time we have lunch let's have a cohort man yeah totally yeah I mean I got some prxs to figure out but I'm eager to start that adventure and makes me think of actually this very close friend of mine who unfortunately passed away in the last handful of months Roland Griffith's amazing scientist from Johns Hopkins and we spent a lot of time together and he had his kids relatively late and by relatively I mean compared to other people in his family and when he had his first kid his his brother slapped him on the shoulder and said welcome to the human race that's cool and I've thought about that a lot I had a friend tell me he's got three kids he's one of the best dads I've ever known he said when you have kids it's leveling up in the Journey of becoming a man and I feel that the more I take these small steps it's like a little role playing game and this is next level and I was stuck like you know I was stuck at a lower level and I'm ready to I'm ready for the next level I'm excited for you brother thanks for taking the time today so nice to see you people can find you at hu.com that's probably the easiest is there any particular social where you most active no I love our Facebook group is a lot of fun and I'm on whatever Twitter's calling itself these days yeah so facebook.com Hua same for Twitter xhua Hugh Hoy on Instagram as well Hugh Hoy such a pleasure always to see you man my pleasure man all right man I love spend in t with you I'll see you soon\",\n",

this altitude I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking can I ask you a personal question now we a see the broken time what if I did the opposite I'm a cybernetic organism living dissue over metal [Music] endoskeleton hello boys and girls ladies and germs this is Tim Ferris welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferris show and this is one of my favorite types of episodes of course I'm speaking to world class performers of all different disciplines all the time but one of my favorite people to ask for advice is Seth Goden and this is a Walkin talk which means Seth and I were walking and talking while we recorded this and I had many burning questions I wanted to ask he did not fail to deliver a lot of sage advice tactical practical wisdom and what more can I say the guy's a gem he delivers every time who is Seth Goden you might ask Seth Goden is the author of 21 International bestsellers that have changed the way people think about work his books have been translated into 38 languages and Seth's books include tribes Purple Cow lynchpin the dip and this is marketing Seth writes one of the most popular marketing blogs in the world 8500 8,500 plus daily blog posts just to put that into perspective and two of his TED Talks are among the most popular of all time he is the founder of the alt MBA the social media Pioneer squid do and yo-yo dine one of the first internet companies his latest book is the song of significance a new Manifesto for teams you can find him at Seth golden.com and you can find Seth's blog at seth. blog so you can go to both of those for a lot of resources and I'm going to just reiterate why we did this format the way we did it because there's too much sitting in the world it's not good for you we weren't evolved to do it and I am trying to counteract the trend the impulse all the incentives to do podcasts in a fixed location this isn't good for my health and it's certainly not good for your health to force you to consume it that way so I'm at least experimenting with being out and about doing something that we are designed to do and that is walk so without further Ado please enjoy my wide ranging conversation where I ask for a lot of help from Seth Goen all right here we are so thank you again for taking the time and the subject I suppose relates to time attention all these good things which is how to make Tim Ferris is incredibly long form writing shorter or how those two things fundamentally are different in terms of long and short I texted you asking if there's any Secret Sauce any tips or tricks for writing short blog posts because I consider you the Undisputed King of consistently good short blog posts and that kind of Uncorked all of this so here we are and uh I suppose where I might want to start is with our initial text thread and one of the points that at least as I read it seemed to resonate was treating blog posts more as a question than an answer or a provocation rather than a prescription could you expand on that a little bit because I think it relates also to the post that you so kindly proof read where I may have misinterpreted how best to think about that I would be delighted to dive in there are so many places to start I'm going to start with this you are a gifted and generous writer and you have been since I began tracking what you do and blogging is inherently a generous act because it's hard in 2024 to justify it as a financial Endeavor you're doing it to illuminate and what does it mean to write in this form a short story attributed to Ernie Hemingway probably not for sale baby shoes never worn six words it's perfect in six words your heart breaks that's not scalable practical repeatable you can't sign up to write six word short stories that break people's hearts every day because that level of condensing that level of being able to get at the heart none of the words had more than seven letters none of the words have more than two syllables that's magic right we can't repeatedly do that so when we look at the form of a Blog we say well you know Seth's blog posts have 100 to a thousand words in them all I have to do is take my idea and make it shorter and when we try to do that resistance kicks in pressfield's resistance and we say but I need to clarify this sentence and add a parenthetical to that sentence or else I will be misunderstood so this first sentence in this paragraph which is Rich and detailed and recursive and layered goes like this growth agents have a place in medicine parentheses some types of hypop poopari inis wasting syndromes diseases surgical care Etc and some sports effectively require them at higher levels but there are always trade-offs when you turn on the dials on complex hormonal Cascades and feedback loops y everything in that is true and someone could study that sentence in college for a month because there's layers below layers below layers and unfortunately the blog reader in general is not ready to consume that level of condensation mhm and so we shouldn't even try because that's not what a Blog is good at mhm what a Blog is good at is what Scott McLoud taught us about Comics Scott mccloud's book about Comics which is a must read I have read it or understanding Comics is the one that I read understanding Comics thank you yes the key lesson is this Comics work because something happens between the panels uh right and panel one Superman sees a problem in panel two Superman is with the villain we don't see how Superman got from panel one to panel two that happened in our brain so the reason Bad Comics and bad graphic novels are bad is because the Creator didn't understand that they didn't let our brain do the leaping they just decided to add a lot of pictures to a story that would be better in words so what a blog post does is it says here's a sketch over here and now I'm over there you figure out how I got from here to there and by you figuring it out the reader you will grow you will explore you will be a voice in this dialogue it is not just me talking MH so when you ask me to review your writing some people are tempted to proofread and they don't really mean proofread they mean copy edit and copy editing means fix the errors and what I'm trying to do when I'm editing a friend work is say are they even asking the right question cuz they can fix their own errors they don't need my help to do that and so here what I'm trying to say is what is this post for and what it's for I think is to help someone who's not paying attention to realize that there are seven things they might want to think about and seven is a lot so what I pitched back to is this is actually seven blog posts in a series and what the first one says is you know there's some things you're not thinking about that you might want to think about here's one of them and the idea if I just say to somebody biceps are temporary baseball helmet sizes are forever they visualize that immediately MH and then they're like H what and then they want to think about what you meant by that it's a ha cou it's a puzzle it's a shadow where is the light and what is being reflected so now you gotten permission to tell me in a paragraph or two what you meant and then I can you get to say and I say and that is the form that is what blogs are good at but and I'm going to end my rant now the downside is you will be misunderstood and that is why there are no comments on my blog because people who misunderstood a post would then respond by making me feel bad so I would over right and overwrite so they wouldn't do that anymore and then it wasn't a Blog anymore so I had to stop and basically what I'm saying is if you don't get it ask a friend and if they don't get it either come back tomorrow and we can discuss a new thing and I think the king of this is actually the magic of XKCD which is a Blog in graphic form yeah it's outstanding I agree on that and as you're talking a few things come to mind for me and maybe as a backdrop the for a lot of this for me at least is number one to get back into writing and to experiment with a new form a new style a new approach to writing and number two is to explore ideas to explore ideas in various ways to clarify my own thinking Y which ended up happening in this short piece the no biological free lunch piece that you proof read I suppose my question not copyedited which is certainly a very different thing in this particular case if you were writing this would you be inclined to make it a series or would you make each of these a standalone piece in other words of those seven bullets as you're thinking through not just the word count right this is my mistake where I basically said okay instead of writing a 5,000 word blog post I'm gonna make it less than a thousand but I'm G to try to still somehow get all of the concepts into this shorter form seems like there's a conceptual con straint that makes things powerful but would you take those seven make them into an interrelated series would you make them all kind of independent after you introduce them in this one piece how would you think about divvying this up conceptually for yourself and I should also just add one more thing which is yeah fundamental to all of these observations and questions and goals and dreams of mine is how do I make this sustainable for me right which is part of the feedback you gave in the comments on on the draft of this blog post was I'm paraphrasing but if you try to just make the 5,000 words thing a th000 words it's going to be exhausting for you and most likely also exhausting for your readers which I agree with this about genre so my blog is a long running series it has been a series of 8,500 Daily Posts so if I was starting today I have to figure out what is the genre of my work if you think about David Letterman TV show mhm he needed to have a series called stupid pet tricks cuz the show wasn't stupid pet tricks but there was a regular recurring stupid petrick right the show was a series of David Letterman shows so if your genre as you reenter blogging is uh there is a post from Tim on a regular basis and all of them are about the things we put into our body and performance that you're fine if that's not the case then the question is when the reader shows up do you need to do a lot of throat clearing to get them back on track for what you are writing about today and so since you're starting with largely a blank slate I said well if the first seven of these are in this series then you only have to clear your throat once on the 8th day and say okay now we're talking about this and you could do one of those or six of those or 12 of those mhm but people do better if they understand that they're going to see Dune not read the power broker those are different genres and you need to give them a hint as to what they're going to get I like the idea of recognizing that my tendency is to how should I be generous with myself be comprehensive was gonna say over complicate but let's be nice try to be comprehensive I would rather as we talked about earlier I'm walking by tennis court right now and I remember taking a tennis lesson and I kept hitting the ball into the net and the coach said to me he's like you can do anything now next step you can hit the ball straight up in the air you can hit a home run the one thing you cannot do is hit it into the net and I was like okay I got it and I kind of feel like I need to give myself some marching orders like that for writing to counterbalance some of my Tendencies so I like the idea of writing self sustaining independent pieces to restrict myself from the desire to say you know what I'm not going to overwrite this but it's going to be part one in a 12p part series which is uh maybe a workaround uh for tricking myself I'm gonna interrupt you for a little bit the please do you are extraordinarily skilled at not over complicating your writing or your narratives that's how you got this far that there's very little that you have published where you were the primary researcher and the Breakthrough creator of the original science what you've done is helped people simplify understand what's Happening Here is resistance you are adding parentheticals to protect yourself 100% MH so what I'm pushing you to do is to come up with boundaries so that you can say I did a good job and ship the work now that could involve having very like the rules of ha cou very significant rules where you must have a tagline to come online that's less than 18 wordss and you are allowed to have two footnote links but the rest of it has to be a narrative that you would say to somebody on the telephone and instead of typing them you are just recording each one and letting someone on your team type them if that would be the model you would have to let go of it because you only have a 5-minute phone call you're going to say it as clearly as you can you can add two links when you're done and it's done you got to ship it right but that's not letting the reader down because you've announced to them that that's what this is the genre matters I asked you one question related to how you know when you're done and I'd love for you to answer that again because I suspect I'll have some follow-up questions and either before or after that I would love to know for yourself what typee of rules you have imposed or constraints SL boundaries when you have had your better streaks of writing let's just say all right well we I'll do the first part first because it's easier you asked how do you decide or no when a post is done and I texted back I don't that's the point and then I wrote imagine how hard it would be to have a conversation or even a text thread if we had to Think Through whether our turn to talk was over before we stopped talking right so my model my ritual is I write blog posts in advance and then the night before I review them I rewrite them I delete them so if I get the stomach flu there's still going to be a blog post tomorrow and when I rewrite a blog post the rule is you wa get points if you make it shorter you don't get points if you make it longer and if I can't boil it down more than it already is and it's not deliberately deceptive it's done because the purpose is tell people something they already sort of know in a way that they would be grateful for the chance to forward to other people can you say that one more time Seth that seems important if I can show up with something in your bones you know to be true or interesting or worth thinking about but I can say it in a way that would benefit you if you could share it with your friends and colleagues that's a great blog post benefit you in what possible senses I will give you a trivial one first which is more than once I have blogged about how stupid it is that there's a pull down menu when you're checking out of a shop and there's all 50 states listed that isn't helping anybody we have have ai that can speak English it knows how to turn NY into New York and we do this because 40 years ago or whenever the web was young 25 years ago it was a hack that made life slightly easier for certain programmers and it's just been sticking around ever since there are people like me it really vexes and if I say this and you are one of those vexing people now you can forward it to your Web Master and say see see I said we shouldn't this and so I just gave you a useful thing to share that's trivial but that's sort of the idea is that if you have a brother or a son or a colleague or daughter or a sister who would benefit from the Insight that you think I'm on to you're going to forward it to them and you're going to have a connection with them CU I opened the door and made it possible for you to do that every once in a while I do post something about Claude AI that you didn't know know about and know you go oh great I use Claud thank you very much but that's not really the service my blog offers the service my blog offers is not I'm breaking news it's I am trying to illuminate things that already resonate with people not to add too many parentheticals to this conversation but what is CLA but what is Claude AI Claude AI I can't believe I know something you don't know claw. a is significantly better then chat GPT at certain functions and I think part of it is cuz it doesn't read the web or it says it doesn't read the web so it's not easily distracted but I'm launching a software project in six weeks and the business plan took more than a year and a whole bunch of contributors it's 40 pages long and I uploaded the business plan to Claude And I said please review this highlight contradictions paradoxes and obvious errors and in less than 10 seconds it me a page and a half MBA quality memo that nailed it it just nailed it nailed it nailed it and I was like okay you got me that's great that's great so I use Claude AI every day to read other people's writing my writing critique it give me Insight you could send your post to Claude and it might not have the Insight I had but it would definitely have something to say incredible all right well end parenthesis what are some other elements or practices or constraints or fill-in the blank that have helped you with consistency in terms of blog writing because I have attempted and failed a number of times to build up momentum writing shorter posts and I think a lot of what we've already discussed will help is there anything else that you would add to the it helped my consistency streak category well I would say two things first I think you're talking about consistency in terms of showing up at the Ballpark every day Cadence yeah exactly yeah so I'll do that one second the first one I have never met Larry David but I am guessing that there are some days that Larry David is actually a nice thoughtful person and there is a character named Larry David as well so the person who writes my blog is a character named Seth Goden and I am the only person who has ever written my blog I the only person who ever will write my blog but when I am doing it I am playing the character named Seth goed so if it doesn't sound like me if it's just me authentically being tired or annoyed I don't publish those because that's not what my character would do it's this is not me exposing some mystical mythical Seth Goden to the world it's me portraying the character Seth Goden CU it's a service and then the second thing is streaks are usually used against us by software and if they make you feel bad it's not a helpful thing but I write blog posts every single day whether I use them or not and I learned that from Isaac azimov when I worked with him all those years ago if you know that tomorrow morning you have to start typing tonight when you go to sleep or today when you're walking around you will be noticing things so that you have something to type and you know I've have enough in reserve that I don't have to do it every day but I do it every day because I eat lunch every day and because I take a shower every day two follow-ups so the first is related to the playing the character of Seth Goden it sounds like if I heard you correctly you're saying your writing should reflect how you feel in the world at the time that you're writing am I hearing that correctly no it's it's the opposite of that it's the opposite there's no should here first of all if someone wants to write a blog that's just the unvarnished version of them in the moment go for it I don't care I'm not the blog police what I'm saying is I can read a blog post I wrote 14 years ago and I might not write the same one today but it rhymes with the one I would write today because there's a voice that this character has that I am very comfortable with I did the first thing that all writers do when I got chat GPT which is I asked it to write like me and I was pleased to discover it was a parody of me and being able to be parodied is a really good sign and that's what it is to have this voice is to say I could exaggerate it in six different directions and people could tell I would be parodying it but like you know the Peanuts comic strip Charles Schultz did it every single day and it's very hard to tell which decade a peanut strip is from totally and that's that's what I'm after so just to unpack that a little bit more I know we've talked before or I should say I've asked and listen to you discuss how the authenticity fetishizing that goes on is often not always but often very misplaced and just kind of overvalues this oversharing what are the things that make Seth the character Seth the character is it 80% voice that you've developed such that chat GPT can imitate you and Par to you what are the other ingredients that make Seth the character who writes on Seth's blog you know I've not ever pushed myself to name them because seeing is forgetting the name of what one sees but yeah I guess I'd highlight a couple things the first one is I try to begin from a place of the benefit benefit of the doubt of there probably aren't bad people there's just situations that cause people to do things that are troubling and a level of optimism to go with it I try to reduce ideas to their Essence without becoming hyperbolic because the voices of social media amped up the hyperbolic part that's not a simplification that's an exaggeration right I try to eliminate parentheticals unless I really have no choice so I will avoid saying something like all tall people are very brave because that's ridiculous but I will not write tall people or Brave parentheses except for this person this person this person and this person because now it's not worth reading right so there's an assertion at the beginning that creates a t and then a release of that tension that lands an idea so the shortest blog post I ever wrote which I'm really proud of is first line is you don't need more time so that's an assertion it's controversial people who feel overwhelmed want to challenge it and then the delivery is you just need to decide so that flips it upside down takes the blame off off the system and the people who are making you busy and puts it right back on you giving you agency and authority and responsibility to Simply decide and then get back to what needs to get done and so in just a few words that's an example of a short Seth Goen blog post and a longer one is one where I will try to teach somebody details about something they didn't know but frame it in a way that they're comfortable with because that's how they might have framed it as well let me ask a quick question and maybe that I've cut back on my caffeine too significantly but you don't need more time you just need to decide what are people deciding well folks who say I'm going to figure out which college I want to apply to soon I just need to do more research I just need to think about it I got it right close the open Loops get it done make a decision exactly mhm that makes a lot of sense just a quick

have discussed it what are some other things you picked up from Isaac azimov I mean this guy's a demigod at least a lot of people would consider him one what are things you absorbed or observed with Isaac Isaac was in his 70s I was 24 and a half maybe 25 it was one of my first projects it was one of his last ones and we would hang out in his apartment near Lincoln Center and I got to spend time with his wife the thing about Isaac azimov is the character of Isaac azimov was a know-it-all egomaniac for the time today he would be seen as humble but he he published 400 books he invented the modern conception of a robot he wrote seminal work on an enormous number of topics a definitive book about the Bible I mean all over the place but in person he was humble and funny and as a project partner he was completely hands off he spent time with me to make sure I understood the bound Ines of what an Isaac aam project was and then he said go for it and he didn't micromanage a thing because he trusted me and my understanding of where the robots Universe could go and it spoiled me because I thought that was going to happen again and again and again and you know I got Stanley Kaplan into the test prep book business and it took seven years and by the time we the book Stanley was long gone from the project CU he had sold the company but talk about micromanaging with a well-known name so I'm one end of the spectrum was Isaac azimov and on the other end was Stanley Kaplan go figure you know your story about azimov makes me think a little bit of Rick rubben where right out of the gate LL Cool J BC boys he's like oh this is easy this is how it works fantastic what was the project that you're were working with isacon okay so before DVDs lots of people had VCRs and yes I remember a company called Parker Brothers took their board game Clue and they made it into a VCR game and it was Dumb and it sold more than a million copies at $40 wow good for them and so Peter alatka the greatest game designer of his generation and I invented a murder mystery game you could play on your VCR so there was a movie shot with real Union actors in a set in New York City it lasted 38 minutes and took place on another planet about robots and murder and detectives and six times during the short film a screen came up and said hit the pause button and play a card so you would hit pause and you had a stack of six cards and each card had two sides and you would throw a card down and it would be a clue like there are no fingerprints on the gun which might mean it was a robot cuz robots don't have fingerprints right and on the other side of the card it said there were fingerprints on the gun so now you know it's not a robot so it turned out that 2 to the^ of 6 is 150 six or whatever and if you added up the code numbers on the top of each card you played it told you which page in the answer booklet had the answer to that thread through the game so you could play the game hundreds of times and it would be a different outcome each time and we sold the rights to Kodak and cisc and Ebert gave it two thumbs up and advertised it on the Olympics like the full thing it was fascinating wow where were you in your career that that opportunity presented itself or you found that opportunity what had led up to that outside of what you just described so before I did that I had only one real job and my job was at Spiner software we invented educational computer games and I built the first brand of Illustrated computer adventure games I worked with Arthur C Clark and Ray Bradbery and Michael Brighton I got rights to games I worked with Byron price he had a team of programmers and I had a team of programmers we did The Wizard of Oz and I loved it I could still be doing it to this day but the world changed and I was out on my own after a couple years as a book packager but Peter and I knew each other and the momentum from the interactive game thing led me to Isaac's editor and no one had ever asked for the rights the rights weren't expensive and then once I had the rights I found Kodak and Kodak was able to put up the money so we could build this thing and own part of the back end so if I zoom out I have a macro level question for you which has been on my mind a lot if you don't mind which is a question of how you choose next chapters or projects because I'm coming up on the 10th anniversary of the podcast next April so in a few months and figured that would be a good a time as any to pause and reflect on things and think about where I want to go love doing the podcast don't plan on stopping it but there are a lot of Trends driving it towards effectively turning podcasts into fixed location television shows and I don't have much desire to do that y I don't want to be contrarian just for the sake of being contrarian that's its own trap or set of traps but I know you've been very deliberate for instance in choosing not to start a dozen startups and and in favor of choosing to spend your time on other things how do you choose or think about kind of next chapters or how what advice might you give me as I contemplate for what's next type of question you know I think it's very kind of you to say I'm very good at it I don't think I'm good at it but because I'm sort of in public and I do it in a certain way it's noted you know I did five years of a Kimbo it was in the top 1% of all podcasts and then I just stopped and I stopped not because I didn't love it I did love it I stopped because if I kept doing it there's something else I wouldn't do instead and creating a vacuum is required so that I will do the hard work of filling the vacuum but if I just keep doing the thing then there is no vacuum and sometimes the technology changes that's why Spiner went away that's why you couldn't keep making VCR games it's why my Head Start in the cdrom business was worthless cuz CD ROMs went away i' liked in every time I did this being a Pioneer in a New Media space because that's for me the funnest spot and then when the technology changes I got to move on but podcast technology is never going to change I mean you're noting there's a change in the production format and that is a change so in my case what I'm trying to do is not maximize my my income per hour spent nor am I trying to maximize the size of my audience what I'm trying to maximize is are the people I'm serving glad that I did that I showed up to solve an interesting problem and two as I build the stack of things on the bookshelf behind me can I point to them and say that was interesting and generous and I'm glad I did it and you know that's part of a limited attention span theater so it's not for everybody but my whole point of view is that life is projects it is not a job and when you stopped the podcast and created that vacuum did you already have something kind of warming up in the batting cage that was pending that you need to create that vacuum for or did you create the vacuum and then wait for something to get pulled into it not to strain the metaphor but you get the idea no you're not straining it if there's something pending it's not a vacuum there have been times when something so good came along I did it and then how to remove things so I could do it you know when a few of us started squido which was one of the first social networks I had a completely or reorganized my life because we built the 40th biggest website in the US with only eight employees so we were busy this is not what I'm talking about I am talking about an actual uncomfortable vacuum where you feel like you're never going to work again where nothing can possibly be worth what you gave up and that's hard to do yeah it is to do so just to put a put a microscope on that I have as means of backstory done this for periods of time and have found it deeply deeply uncomfortable sometimes fruitful often times not terribly fruitful in part I think because when I create that vacuum I don't know if the best way to embrace the vacuum is to basically just stare at the wall and watch paint dry or to do something else and my mind just kind of folds in on itself you create the VAC and then what do the next few weeks look like in terms of how you spend your time dayto day or week to week I think a fundamental difference between you and me there are so many of them but one of them as I am here talking to what the world Tango Champion former world record holder a long time ago yes is the only thing I have a world record in is being part of the largest co-author book signing in history in which me and 400 other people all signed our book at the same time because I am not a high performer I am interesting and being interesting is really important to me but I am not holding myself to the standard you hold yourself in so many ways and so I could imagine that the thing that gives me Comfort might not make you happy right for sure I agree with all of that and how does that difference translate to what you would do in the weeks following creating the vacuum after say stopping the podcast because I guess you have activities that you're still carrying forward it's not like you're completely idle you're writing still presumably if someone looked at me from the outside I think that they would see that my days aren't that different I am not shipping public work because I don't ship junk but I am internally creating lots of mediocre work and basically creating straw people and saying what would this be like and then what would that be like and here's this thing and I sat with my 60 or 80 watt laser cutter and I cut this thing out what do I think of that and um that invention cycle is joyful but I can't do it forever because I also need the satisfaction of shipping the work and not giving into resistance so what I'm doing when I was a book packager we sold 120 books in 10 years a book a month but I had more than 800 books on my hard drive ready to go not finished but two page five page proposals because the only way to have a finished proposal for me is to have an unfinished one that you didn't ship what is it and this is probably a fundamental question I should have asked earlier but what did you get from writing and having written as consistently as you have and do what is the payoff like why do that okay so the biggest payoff is simple not in terms of equity stock value but in terms of the noise in my head the biggest benefit is I will be writing tomorrow because it's Friday not because I've written the perfect blog post that every single day something gets published by me because I decided that 24 years ago not because I have reconsidered each day whether this one is good enough mhm and even if no one read my blog I would still do it and I'm very fortunate that people give me the benefit of the doubt knowing that I am not guaranteeing this is the best thing I ever wrote and they're still willing to look at it so that's lovely in terms of my professional practice again back to genre having a cure a platform where for a long time if you type blog into Google I was the first match because I just showed up more than just about anybody there's a lot of value to saying this is my lane and you can count on me in this Lane and for someone who is as paretic as I in their creative Pursuits having one of those turned out to be a really useful thing you mentioned a word that I don't recognize but I love the sound of ccure what is that yeah it's a safe haven a niche a place to hide a fortress what a great word yeah all right mental note to use cure well I don't want to take up a ton of time here south this is all incredible incredibly helpful the best part of my day and I know that you're not publishing this as written but I just want to say as for the people who were wondering what's in this magical thing you wrote it includes the line like Patagonian toothfish has become Chilean seab Baths on fashionable menus worldwide right there that's gold Jerry that's just gold and so you need to liberate these things and explain to people what the I know what you're talking about but the fact is that entire species are becoming extinct because somebody figured out a clever way to Market an animal that we eat there's a lot to be said about that one little riff and you have 20 of them in one post thanks man yeah the the no biological freelan it's one of those things things that I've said so many times to friends in conversation and I was finally like you know what if not for any other reason than I am tired of repeating this Gettys Burger dress speech to every Wayward friend who calls me up about to consume really potent drugs I have some of those if you go to Seth stop blog and type advice for authors there are two posts with the same title cuz that's I wasn't being clear that I wrote a year and a half apart and they have each like a dozen or 15 bullet points and now I have a Sig and superum that I can call up if when someone sends me a note a friend or whatever I can say oh I've already thought about this question here you go oh I love it hey guys this is Tim again just one more thing before you take off and that is five bullet Friday would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a little fun before the
